What began on June 9th, 2016, as a personal accountability journal for my goal of achieving financial independence by 30 has since evolved into much more. Initially, this was meant to document my journey of frugal living, strategic investing, and personal growth. However, as I hit my target ahead of schedule, the blog transformed into a platform for sharing actionable strategies and insights with others pursuing similar goals.

Over the years, this blog has grown into a blend of candid reflections on over a decade of investment experience—especially in real estate—and explorations of new curiosities. It’s a space where I share not only the financial aspects of my journey but also the personal growth, education, and life lessons that have come along the way.

Whether you're here for the investment strategies, personal development insights, or simply to be inspired by the pursuit of financial freedom, I aim to provide valuable, educational, and entertaining content. Additionally, this blog serves to enhance my credibility across the industries I’m passionate about while continuing to offer meaningful, long-form content for readers like you.

Thanks for joining me on this journey—I’m excited to share, grow, and learn together!

## About me


*[Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship through the lens of an contrarian opportunist. Explore strategies for growth and impact.](#mission)*

I am an entrepreneur with over a decade of experience in the investment and construction industries, specializing in real estate investment and redevelopment. My focus is on acquiring and revitalizing underperforming grocery-anchored retail centers and office buildings in secondary and tertiary markets across North America, creating value and driving long-term growth.

I began my professional journey in the trades, working as a pipe-fitter in the oil and gas industry. This hands-on experience instilled in me the values of discipline, resilience, and a steadfast focus on achieving financial independence. 

By practicing frugal living and making strategic investments, I transitioned from purchasing, renovating, and managing duplexes and small multi-family properties in Winnipeg to building a diversified portfolio of real estate assets. Over time, the success of these investments, combined with my disciplined savings, enabled me to leave the trades permanently and fully dedicate myself to growing my real estate investment business.

As my track record grew, I began collaborating with investors to take on larger projects, leveraging my experience and success to scale operations. Today, as co-founder of R2 Capital Partners, I lead operations, managing over $65 million in assets across 13 cities in Canada and the United States, with a transaction history exceeding $75 million.

Beyond real estate, I co-founded Sure Home Stays, a tech-enabled international hospitality brand that embraces the sharing economy. Serving over 10,000 guests across 14+ markets in Canada and the United States, Sure Home Stays specializes in vacation rental management, offering luxurious stays while optimizing property performance.

I am a lifelong learner with insatiable curiosity and an avid researcher, passionate about leveraging technology, machine learning, and robotics to create innovative solutions with real-world impact. My approach emphasizes building meaningful relationships, maintaining physical and mental well-being, and living a purpose-driven life.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our two dogs. I believe in the importance of building both a personal and professional life, striving to maintain this through mindfulness and continuous self-improvement.

## <a id="mission"></a>"Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship through the lens of an contrarian opportunist. Explore strategies for growth and impact."

This phrase outlines my mindset and approach to personal and professional development. Here's how I break it down:

### 1. Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship

These represent four pillars of a fulfilling life:

- **Health**: Physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Prioritizing fitness, nutrition, and longevity.
- **Wealth**: Financial stability, growth, and freedom. Building assets that generate income and enable independence.
- **Happiness**: Emotional satisfaction, purpose, and relationships that bring joy and meaning.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Creating value through innovation, solving problems, and seizing opportunities.

### 2. Through the lens of a contrarian opportunist

A contrarian is someone who challenges the status quo, often going against conventional wisdom. They look for opportunities where others see risk or dismissal.

An opportunist identifies and capitalizes on favorable circumstances, turning challenges into advantages.

Together, a contrarian opportunist actively seeks undervalued opportunities or unorthodox approaches to achieve success in these four pillars.

### 3. Explore strategies for growth and impact

- **Growth**: Personal, financial, or entrepreneurial development. Learning new skills, adapting to change, and constantly evolving to become better in all aspects of life.
- **Impact**: Leaving a meaningful legacy, contributing positively to society, and influencing others through actions and innovations.

### What it means in practice

- **Health**: Experiment with biohacking or alternative health strategies that are not yet mainstream.
- **Wealth**: Invest in overlooked markets or assets others avoid, such as niche industries or secondary/tertiary real estate markets.
- **Happiness**: Build a lifestyle focused on intrinsic goals rather than materialistic or societal expectations.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Start ventures in areas dismissed by others, such as underdog technologies, underserved markets, or disruptive business models.

### Core Idea

This approach encourages questioning traditional norms, identifying hidden opportunities, and leveraging unorthodox strategies to achieve comprehensive personal and professional success. It's about not following the herd and instead creating a unique path toward growth and impact.
