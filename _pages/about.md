I am an entrepreneur with over a decade of experience in the investment and construction industries, specializing in real estate private equity. My focus is on acquiring and revitalizing underperforming grocery-anchored retail centers and office buildings in secondary and tertiary markets, driving long-term growth and value creation.

My journey toward financial independence was inspired by my grandfather, who overcame the hardships of the Great Depression to build a successful contracting firm without formal education. His wisdom about maintaining "a wall between you and the man"—achieving financial autonomy to live life on your own terms—has been a guiding principle in my life.

Unfulfilled by the traditional education system and driven by a desire for autonomy, I began my career as a pipe-fitter in the oil and gas industry. Through extreme frugality and disciplined saving, I amassed enough capital to invest in real estate, starting with duplexes and expanding into various asset classes. This path led me to co-found a real estate investment firm that has executed over $55 million in transactions and manages $65 million in assets across 13 cities in Canada and the United States.

Passionate about technology, machine learning, and robotics, I am committed to pursuing opportunities that blend impact with innovation. I believe in building meaningful relationships, maintaining a strong emphasis on health, and creating a life aligned with my values. My journey is a testament to the power of determination, strategic planning, and the relentless pursuit of financial freedom.
