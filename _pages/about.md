What began on June 9th, 2016, as a personal accountability journal for my goal of achieving financial independence by 30 has since evolved into much more. Initially, this was meant to document my journey of frugal living, strategic investing, and personal growth. However, as I hit my initial goal, the blog transformed into a platform for sharing actionable strategies and insights with others pursuing similar goals.

Over the years, this blog has grown into a blend of candid reflections on over a decade of investment experience—especially in real estate—and explorations of new curiosities. It’s a space where I share not only the financial aspects of my journey but also the personal growth, education, and life lessons that have come along the way.

Whether you're here for the investment strategies, personal development insights, or simply to be inspired by the pursuit of financial freedom, I aim to provide valuable, educational, and entertaining content. Additionally, this blog serves to enhance my credibility across the industries I’m passionate about while continuing to offer meaningful, long-form content for readers like you.

Thanks for joining me on this journey—I’m excited to share, grow, and learn together!

## About me


*[Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship through the lens of an contrarian opportunist.](#mission)*

I am an entrepreneur with over a decade of experience in the investment and construction industries, specializing in real estate investment and redevelopment. My focus is on acquiring and revitalizing underperforming grocery-anchored retail centers and office buildings in secondary and tertiary markets across North America, creating value and driving long-term growth.

**My Professional Journey**

I began my career in the trades, working as a pipe-fitter for a fire suppression company and later advanced into the oil and gas industry. This hands-on experience taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of striving for financial independence. Through a commitment to frugal living and strategic investing, I transitioned from my trade work to purchasing, renovating, and managing duplexes and small multi-family properties in Winnipeg.

Over time, these early investments, coupled with disciplined savings, allowed me to leave the trades permanently and focus on real estate full-time. I steadily expanded my portfolio, acquiring diversified real estate assets and honing my skills in property management and value creation.

As my track record grew, I began partnering with investors to take on larger and more complex projects, leveraging my experience to scale operations. Today, as the co-founder of R2 Capital Partners, I lead operations across a portfolio of shopping centres, office buildings, multifamily apartments, and other assets, spanning 13 cities in Canada and the United States.

**Expanding Horizons**

Beyond real estate, I co-founded Sure Home Stays, an international hospitality brand that integrates technology to optimize vacation rental performance. Operating across 14+ markets in Canada and the U.S., Sure Home Stays has welcomed 10,000+ guests, providing luxurious stays while helping property owners maximize returns.

**Passion and Vision**

I’m a lifelong learner with a passion for leveraging technology and machine learning to create innovative solutions that drive real-world impact. I believe in fostering meaningful relationships, prioritizing physical and mental well-being, and pursuing a purpose-driven life.

**Life Beyond Work**

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy spending quality time with my wife and our two dogs. I value mindfulness and continuous self-improvement, striving to build a balanced, fulfilling personal and professional life.

## <a id="mission"></a>"Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship through the lens of an contrarian opportunist. Explore strategies for growth and impact."

This phrase outlines my mindset and approach to personal and professional development. Here's how I break it down:

### 1. Pursuing health, wealth, happiness, and entrepreneurship

These represent four pillars of a fulfilling life:

- **Health**: Physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Prioritizing fitness, nutrition, and longevity.
- **Wealth**: Financial stability, growth, and freedom. Building assets that generate income and enable independence.
- **Happiness**: Emotional satisfaction, purpose, and relationships that bring joy and meaning.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Creating value through innovation, solving problems, and seizing opportunities.

### 2. Through the lens of a contrarian opportunist

A contrarian is someone who challenges the status quo, often going against conventional wisdom. They look for opportunities where others see risk or dismissal.

An opportunist identifies and capitalizes on favorable circumstances, turning challenges into advantages.

Together, a contrarian opportunist actively seeks undervalued opportunities or unorthodox approaches to achieve success in these four pillars.

### 3. Explore strategies for growth and impact

- **Growth**: Personal, financial, or entrepreneurial development. Learning new skills, adapting to change, and constantly evolving to become better in all aspects of life.
- **Impact**: Leaving a meaningful legacy, contributing positively to society, and influencing others through actions and innovations.

### What it means in practice

- **Health**: Experiment with biohacking or alternative health strategies that are not yet mainstream.
- **Wealth**: Invest in overlooked markets or assets others avoid, such as niche industries or secondary/tertiary real estate markets.
- **Happiness**: Build a lifestyle focused on intrinsic goals rather than materialistic or societal expectations.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Start ventures in areas dismissed by others, such as underdog technologies, underserved markets, or disruptive business models.

### Core Idea

This approach encourages questioning traditional norms, identifying hidden opportunities, and leveraging unorthodox strategies to achieve comprehensive personal and professional success. It's about not following the herd and instead creating a unique path toward growth and impact.
