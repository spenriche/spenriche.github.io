I am an entrepreneur with over a decade of experience in the investment and construction industries, specializing in real estate private equity. My focus is on acquiring and revitalizing underperforming grocery-anchored retail centers and office buildings in secondary and tertiary markets, driving long-term growth and value creation.

I began my professional journey in the trades, working as a pipe-fitter in the oil and gas industry. This hands-on experience instilled in me the values of discipline, resilience, and a steadfast focus on achieving financial independence. By practicing frugal living and making strategic investments, I transitioned from purchasing, renovating, and managing duplexes and small multi-family properties in Winnipeg to building a diversified portfolio of real estate assets. Over time, the success of these investments, combined with my disciplined savings, enabled me to leave the trades permanently and fully dedicate myself to growing my real estate investment business.

As my track record grew, I began collaborating with investors to take on larger projects, leveraging my experience and success to scale operations. Today, as co-founder of R2 Capital Partners, I lead operations for a firm managing $65 million in assets across 13 cities in Canada and the United States, with a transaction history exceeding $75 million.

Beyond real estate, I co-founded Sure Home Stays, a tech-enabled international hospitality brand that embraces the sharing economy. Serving over 10,000 guests across 14+ markets in Canada and the United States, Sure Home Stays specializes in vacation rental management, offering luxurious stays while optimizing property performance.

My journey toward entrepreneurship was shaped by years of construction and leadership roles, including:

- Pipe-Fitter and Supervisor: At SA Energy Group, I managed teams in high-pressure environments, playing a key role in large-scale pipeline projects across Canada with a focus on safety and quality.  
- Sprinkler Fitter: At Vipond Inc., I gained expertise in fire protection systems, ensuring compliance and safety across various industries.  
- Athlete and Leader: My early career as a Defensive End in football earned me accolades such as 2x CJFL Defensive Lineman of the Year and CJFL All-Star honors, alongside training with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.  

Outside of real estate, I am passionate about leveraging technology, machine learning, and robotics to create innovative solutions with real-world impact. My approach emphasizes building meaningful relationships, maintaining physical and mental well-being, and living a purpose-driven life.
