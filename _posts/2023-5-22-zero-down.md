Building a real estate portfolio doesn't always require a hefty upfront investment. In fact, with the right strategies, you can acquire properties with minimal out-of-pocket expenses. One such strategy revolves around Vendor Take-Back Mortgages (VTBs), seller financing or earn outs. This blog post will delve into how VTBs work, share a real-life example from my recent acquisition, and explore negotiation tactics to make these deals successful for all parties involved.

## Understanding Vendor Take-Back Mortgages

A Vendor Take-Back Mortgage is when the seller of a property finances a portion of the purchase price for the buyer. Instead of obtaining the full amount from a traditional lender, you agree to pay the seller over time, often with interest. This arrangement, also know as a promissory note, can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers, offering flexibility and the potential for a faster sale. The property will become collateral for the loan, or another asset you have with enough equity.

## Why Focus on VTBs?

- **Ease of Negotiation**: VTBs are straightforward to pitch and understand.
- **Common Practice**: Approximately 60% of all businesses are sold with some form of seller financing.
- **Win-Win Scenario**: Sellers can maximize their sale price, defer capital gains taxes and earn interest, while buyers reduce their immediate cash outlay and maximize returns.

## My Recent Acquisition: A Case Study

![Alt text](/assets/images/vtb/1.jpg)

In January 2023, I purchased an industrial commercial building with an office in the front and a large heated storage shop in the rear, complete with a fenced perimeter. Built in 2017, the property was inherited by the owner from his father. Living on the opposite side of the country, he was keen on selling.

### Property Details

- **Purchase Price**: $440,000  
- **Tenant**: The Canadian government on a 10-year triple net lease  
- **Cap Rate**: Approximately 8.5%  (enough NOI to cover both debt payments and cash flow)
- **VTB Negotiated**: $125,000 (27% of the purchase price)

The reason for a 27% and not 25% VTB is the additional 2% is to cover transations costs, suchas legal, notary, land transfer tax, etc.

### The Triple Net Lease Advantage

Under a triple net lease, the tenant (in this case, the Canadian government) is responsible for all property-related expenses:

- Rent
- Insurance
- Property taxes
- Utilities
- Maintenance and repairs
- Capital expenditures

This arrangement means the property requires minimal management, and the income stream is reliable.

## Structuring the Deal with BDC

To finance the remaining portion of the purchase price, I approached the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). Here's why:

- **Specialization**: BDC focuses on business and commercial real estate lending when traditional banks may not be an option.  
- **Seller Financing as Equity**: BDC considers a seller-financed loan with a term of five years or more as a shareholder investment. This treatment doesn't negatively impact your debt servicing ratios.  
- **High Loan-to-Value Ratios**: BDC can finance up to 85% of the property's value, though at slightly higher interest rates.

### Deal Terms with BDC and the Seller

- **Seller Financing**: $125,000 at 5% interest-only payments, with a balloon payment after five years.  
- **BDC Financing**: 75% of the purchase price.  
- **Payment Structure**: Monthly interest-only payments to the seller; standard loan repayments to BDC.  
- **Future Options**: At the end of five years, refinance the property to pay off the seller or negotiate an extension.

**One critical** aspect of vendor take-back mortgages is ensuring that the property you're acquiring can service the debt. The investment must produce enough income to cover both the VTB interest and the mortgage interest, ideally generating sufficient cash flow to make the endeavor worthwhile. Seller financing doesn't work when the numbers and cash flow are weak, because you'll end up paying out of pocket each month to own the asset. While this might be acceptable if your goal is simply to build a large asset base, I prefer to maintain a cash cushion. Therefore, I need to ensure that the property itself can cover all debts and still generate positive cash flow, which is why entering with a higher cap rate is essential.

It's also important to plan your exit strategy. If the seller expects their money back in five years at the end of the VTB term, you need to determine how you'll repay them. Ideally, the property you're purchasing has room for improvement and offers a value-add opportunity. This allows you to increase the property's value, refinance based on the enhanced equity, and use those funds to pay off the loan. Alternatively, you might have funds coming from another venture or investment to settle the debt. Remember, it's not guaranteed that the seller will be willing to extend the loan beyond the initial five years.

Lastly, the key to successful **VTB negotiation** is how you present the proposal to the vendor. A common mistake is approaching with a low offer and simultaneously requesting seller financing, which can seem self-centered. Instead, it's essential to structure the deal so that it benefits everyone involved. You may need to concede on certain aspects to make the transaction appealing. Personally, I'd rather overpay by 5% to acquire a $500,000 cash flowing asset without any out-of-pocket expense than save 20% on the purchase price but have to invest $150,000 upfront for the same asset. Save the 20% for another investment where a VTB is not an option.

## Negotiation Tactics: The Multiple Offer Strategy

One effective way to introduce seller financing is through a multiple offer scenario, I always submit 3 offers. Here's how I approach it:

- **Low All-Cash Offer**: A materially below-market offer with quick closing terms. Ideal if the property is distressed and needs significant work.  
- **Standard Financing Offer**: A moderate offer, still below asking price, contingent on traditional financing with a typical closing period.  
- **Full-Price Offer with VTB**: An offer at or slightly above the asking price, including a significant vendor financing component.  

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Understanding Seller Motivations**: By presenting multiple options, you can gauge what's most important to the seller‚Äîquick cash, ongoing income, or maximum price.  
- **Flexibility**: You're prepared to proceed with any of the offers, ensuring you're comfortable with the terms.  
- **Win-Win Negotiation**: Demonstrates your willingness to accommodate the seller's needs while achieving your investment goals.

## Advantages for the Seller

VTBs offer several benefits to the seller:
 
- **Passive Income**: Provides a steady income stream without the responsibilities of property management.  
- **Security**: The property serves as collateral; if the buyer defaults, the seller retains ownership.  
- **Higher Sale Price**: Sellers may receive full asking price or more due to the favorable financing terms offered to the buyer.  
- **Tax Deferral**: Spreading the income over several years can delay large taxable events. 

## Making the Deal Work for Everyone

The key to successfully negotiating a VTB is to ensure that the transaction benefits all parties involved. Here are some tips:

- **Focus on Mutual Benefits**: Highlight how the arrangement meets both your needs and the seller's.  
- **Be Willing to Compromise**: Sometimes, paying slightly more is worthwhile if it means acquiring an asset with minimal upfront costs.  
- **Communicate Clearly**: Explain the terms and benefits in simple language to build trust and understanding.  

## Utilizing Finder's Fees and Improvement Credits

You can employ additional "cash on closing" strategies to reduce your out-of-pocket expenses:

### Finder's Fees

- **Definition**: A commission paid to you by the seller for facilitating the transaction, similar to a realtor's commission.  
- **Implementation**: Negotiate a finder's fee of around 2% of the purchase price. This fee can be included in the purchase price or offset through other terms.  
- **Benefit**: Provides cash at closing to cover immediate expenses like closing costs.

### Renovation or Improvement Credits

- **Purpose**: Funds provided by the seller to cover repairs or capital expenditures needed after purchase.  
- **Negotiation**: Request improvement credits during the deal structuring. These can be added to the purchase price or the VTB amount.  
- **Advantage**: Reduces the financial burden of property improvements and enhances cash flow from the outset.

## Vendor Take-Back Mortgages (VTBs)

A Vendor Take-Back Mortgage is a type of financing where the seller of a property provides a loan to the buyer to cover a portion of the purchase price. In this arrangement, the seller essentially "takes back" a mortgage from the buyer, acting as the lender.

### How It Works:

- The seller agrees to finance a portion of the sale by providing a mortgage to the buyer.
- The buyer makes regular payments (including interest) to the seller instead of a traditional bank.
- The mortgage is secured against the property, giving the seller recourse if the buyer defaults.

### Benefits for the Buyer:

- **Easier Qualification**: Helpful if the buyer has difficulty securing full financing from traditional lenders.
- **Flexible Terms**: Interest rates and repayment schedules can be negotiated directly.
- **Reduced Upfront Costs**: May lower the down payment required.

### Benefits for the Seller:

- **Broadened Market**: Attracts more potential buyers.
- **Income Stream**: Generates ongoing income from interest payments.
- **Potential Tax Advantages**: Spreads out capital gains over time.

## Seller Financing

Seller financing is a broader term that includes any arrangement where the seller provides financing to the buyer. A VTB is a specific form of seller financing.

### How It Works:

- The seller and buyer agree on financing terms without involving a traditional lender.
- The buyer makes payments directly to the seller over an agreed-upon period.

### Common Structures:

- **Promissory Notes**: A written promise to pay the seller under specific terms.
- **Land Contracts**: The seller retains legal title until the buyer fulfills payment obligations.
- **Lease-Purchase Agreements**: The buyer leases the property with an option to purchase.

### Advantages and Considerations:

- **Customization**: Terms can be tailored to meet both parties' needs.
- **Speed**: Can expedite the sale process by bypassing traditional lending approvals.
- **Risk Management**: Sellers should perform due diligence to assess the buyer's creditworthiness.

## Earn-Outs

An earn-out is a contractual provision commonly used in business acquisitions where the seller receives additional compensation based on the future performance of the business.

### How It Works:

- Part of the purchase price is deferred and contingent on achieving specific targets (e.g., revenue, profit).
- The period for the earn-out typically ranges from one to three years post-sale.
- Payments are calculated based on agreed-upon formulas tied to performance metrics.

### Benefits for the Buyer:

- **Risk Mitigation**: Aligns the purchase price with actual business performance.
- **Seller Motivation**: Keeps the seller engaged in ensuring the business succeeds post-sale.

### Benefits for the Seller:

- **Potential for Higher Earnings**: Opportunity to receive more than the initial sale price if targets are exceeded.
- **Confidence Signal**: Demonstrates belief in the ongoing success of the business.

### Challenges:

- **Complexity**: Requires clear definitions of performance metrics and accounting methods.
- **Potential for Disputes**: Differences in management styles may impact performance and lead to conflicts.

## Exploring the Capital Stack and Leveraging Equity Investment With VTBs
Understanding the capital stack is essential when structuring real estate deals, especially those involving creative financing like Vendor Take-Back Mortgages. The capital stack represents the hierarchy of financial sources used to fund a property acquisition, each with its own risk and return profile.

### Components of the Capital Stack

- **Senior Debt**: This is typically the largest portion, secured by a first lien on the property. It carries the lowest risk and, consequently, the lowest interest rate.
- **Mezzanine Debt**: Sits between senior debt and equity. It has a higher risk and interest rate than senior debt but is still secured, often through ownership interests.
- **Preferred Equity**: Investors receive preferential treatment in profit distributions before common equity holders but after debt obligations are met.
- **Common Equity**: Represents ownership stake. These investors take on the highest risk but also have the potential for the highest returns.

### Combining VTBs with Equity Investments

For larger deals, an effective strategy is to raise additional equity capital in combination with a Vendor Take-Back Mortgage. Here's how you can structure such a deal:

- **Seller's VTB Contribution**: Negotiate a VTB where the seller finances, say, 10% of the purchase price.
- **Equity Raising**: Raise an additional 10-15% from private investors interested in the deal.
- **Leveraged Returns**: With less of your own money invested, both you and your investors can achieve higher returns on investment.

### Benefits of This Approach
Maximized Purchasing Power: Enables you to pursue larger or more lucrative properties that might be unattainable using personal funds alone.
- **Enhanced Investor Appeal**: Offering a structured deal with multiple layers of financing can attract investors seeking diversified risk.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Distributes financial risk across debt, seller financing, and equity investors.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you're looking at a commercial property priced at $1,000,000:

- **Senior Debt (Traditional Mortgage)**: 75% of the purchase price ($750,000) financed through a bank or lender.
- **Vendor Take-Back Mortgage**: 10% ($100,000) provided by the seller.
- **Equity Investment**: 15% ($150,000) raised from private investors.
- **Your Personal Investment**: Minimal to none, depending on the deal structure.

In this setup:

Investors contribute $150,000 in exchange for equity stakes.
- You manage the property and oversee the investment, leveraging the combined capital to acquire the asset.
- Returns are distributed according to agreed-upon terms, often favoring investors until they receive a certain return threshold.

### Enhancing Returns for Investors and Yourself

By reducing the amount of personal and investor capital required (thanks to the VTB), the overall return on equity increases because:

- **Less Capital at Risk**: Smaller initial investment boosts ROI metrics.
- **Debt Leverage**: Utilizing more debt (in the form of VTB and senior loans) amplifies returns during profitable periods.
- **Profit Sharing**: Clear agreements can ensure that once investors receive their preferred returns, additional profits can be shared or allocated to you as the deal sponsor.

### Key Considerations When Raising Equity

- **Investor Relations**: Maintain transparency with your investors. Clearly outline the terms, risks, and expected returns.
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to securities laws and regulations when raising capital to avoid legal pitfalls.
- **Due Diligence**: Thoroughly vet the property to ensure it can meet the financial projections necessary to satisfy all layers of the capital stack.
- **Exit Strategy**: Have a clear plan for refinancing or selling the property to repay debts and provide returns to investors.

## Conclusion

Building a real estate portfolio with minimal personal investment is achievable through creative financing strategies like Vendor Take-Back Mortgages. By understanding the benefits to both buyers and sellers and employing effective negotiation tactics, you can acquire valuable assets without significant upfront costs.

Remember, the goal is to create a win-win situation. When both parties see the advantages, transactions proceed smoothly, and long-term relationships are fostered. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting, exploring VTBs and other seller financing methods can accelerate your portfolio growth while conserving your capital.
