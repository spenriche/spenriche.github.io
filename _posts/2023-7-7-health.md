Living a life optimized for performance and longevity is a constant journey of self-discovery, experimentation, and commitment. Through years of trial and error, I‚Äôve developed a system that supports peak physical performance, mental sharpness, and a lifestyle I can sustain long-term. Below, I‚Äôll break down the key components of my approach: nutrition, training, and routine.

## Nutrition

### The Meat-Centric Paleo Diet ü•©
After testing numerous diets, the one that has consistently provided the most dramatic results for me is a meat-centric paleo diet. This diet, heavily inspired by my trials with the carnivore diet, consists of meat making up 90% of my intake. It emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods and eliminates most grains, refined sugars, and seed oils.

**Benefits I‚Äôve Experienced:**
- Leaner physique: Visible reduction in bloating and inflammation.
- Improved sleep: Waking up energized every day without an alarm.
- Better skin health: Clearer, more vibrant complexion.
- Joint pain relief: No more nagging discomfort, even after intense training.
- Increased strength: Enhanced performance while maintaining a lower overall weight.

**Practical Advantages:**
- Ease of preparation: Buying meat in bulk from local butchers simplifies meal prep.
- Simplicity: Fewer ingredients, less cooking complexity.

Apart from the incredible taste and benefits of a meat-centric Paleo diet, it‚Äôs also the easiest to follow. As I always say, **If it didn‚Äôt exist 100 years ago, don‚Äôt eat it.** This simple rule eliminates all boxed, processed, and lab-made foods, making healthy choices straightforward and natural.

### Intermittent Fasting (IF) üïí
I follow a daily eating window from 12 PM to 6 PM, during which I consume two primary meals. This approach has been transformative for me, and here‚Äôs why:

**Consistency:**  
I eat the same meals every day. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and aligns with my preference for routine. Buying and cooking in bulk saves time and money, making it an efficient and affordable lifestyle.

**Research Benefits of IF:**
- **Longevity:** Studies, including research on animals such as fasted dogs, suggest caloric restriction and intermittent fasting may extend lifespan by 30%, promoting cellular repair and reducing oxidative stress. Imagine extending human lifespan by 30%! Assuming the average age is 80, we‚Äôre talking 24 additional years! Imagine another 24 years of compound interest working its magic.
- **Mental Clarity:** Fasting stabilizes blood sugar levels, reducing energy crashes and carb-induced slumps, leaving me sharp and focused throughout the day.
- **Natural Rhythms:** My body has adapted to this schedule. I wake up naturally between 4‚Äì5 AM without an alarm, feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.
- **Efficiency:** Fewer meals mean less time spent preparing food and making dietary decisions, freeing up mental and physical energy for other priorities.

### Daily Meals: üçΩÔ∏è
- **Meal One (12 PM):**  
  Extra lean ground beef mixed with vegetables and eggs.
- **Meal Two (5 PM):**  
  Steak (ribeye, NY strip, or smoked brisket) paired with vegetables.

üßÇ No sauces, no condiments, just pink himalayan salt, peper and the odd spice.

**Snacks:**
- [Whey protein smoothies](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0C1H8Q4GD?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_7&amp=&crid=33KWYW1I5XYL9&sprefix=diesel%2B&th=1) (sugar-free) blended with almond milk, ice, and sometimes berries.
- Black espresso.
-  [Home-brewed flavor-free carbonated water.](https://spenriche.github.io/diy/food/sustainability/2023/04/20/diy-carbon/)

This routine fuels my body efficiently, aligns with my goals for health and longevity, and keeps my lifestyle streamlined and productive.

**Supplements:** üíä
- **[BCAAs (powder](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07PC2RJRR/):** Supports muscle recovery.
- **[L-Glutamine (powder, unflavored)](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0CCJZY4C2):** Aids in gut health and muscle recovery.
- **[Glucosamine (capsules)](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00B4LZNYM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1):** For joint support.

### Final Thoughts on Diets
My overall opinion on most diets is that they are largely overrated and often overcomplicated. Many diets are built on trendy buzzwords and rigid rules that don‚Äôt consider individual needs or long-term sustainability. At the end of the day, what truly matters boils down to three key factors:

- **How You Feel:** Your energy levels, mood, digestion, and overall physical performance are the best indicators of whether a particular eating style is working for you. A diet isn‚Äôt successful if it leaves you feeling fatigued, irritable, or unwell.

- **Your Blood Work:** Objective health markers, like cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and inflammation markers, provide a clear picture of your internal health. Tracking these can show if your nutrition choices are truly supporting your body, regardless of how ‚Äúpopular‚Äù the diet might be.

- **Calories In vs. Calories Out:** The fundamental principle of weight management remains consistent: your body composition is primarily determined by energy balance. While food quality matters for health, the quantity of food you consume dictates whether you lose, maintain, or gain weight.


[In this post](https://spenriche.github.io/2023/04/29/lessons/), I‚Äôve outlined the simple, no-nonsense secret to achieving your dream body and health goals. Spoiler alert: it doesn‚Äôt involve obsessing over fad diets or miracle solutions. Instead, it‚Äôs about finding what works for your unique lifestyle, prioritizing balance, and focusing on measurable outcomes like how you feel, what your health metrics show, and maintaining a sustainable calorie balance.

The truth is, there‚Äôs no "one-size-fits-all" diet. The key is to adopt habits that support your goals and lifestyle while keeping things straightforward, enjoyable, and adaptable to real life.

## Training Routine üèãÔ∏è

### Daily Cardio
I begin every training session with 45‚Äì60 minutes of cardio, alternating between running and the elliptical to allow recovery from high-impact sessions. My runs usually cover 8‚Äì10 km at a steady pace of 7 mph - 8 mph. This foundational cardiovascular work enhances endurance, supports weight management, and promotes mental clarity.

### Resistance Training
Resistance training forms the foundation of my program, emphasizing compound movements that engage multiple muscle groups. I structure my training into two distinct styles: high-intensity and low-intensity days. The choice between these is guided by how my body feels on a given day, factoring in recovery from previous sessions, sleep quality, and overall energy levels.

### Training Routine: Target Muscle Groups and Training Principles

#### Target Muscle Groups
- **Push:** Chest, shoulders, and triceps.
- **Pull:** Back and biceps.
- **Legs:** Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, incorporating various plyometrics.

#### High-Intensity Days (For High Energy)
**Focus:**  
Strength development through low reps (5‚Äì8) with heavy weights.

**Format:**  
4‚Äì5 sets per exercise, increasing weight by 5 lbs once the upper rep range is achieved.

**Key Movements:**
- Squats
- Deadlifts
- Bench Press
- Overhead Press
- Pull-Ups
- Dips
- Barbell Rows

**Goal:**  
Build strength and fast-twitch muscle fibers by prioritizing proper form while moving maximum weight loads.

#### Low-Intensity Days (For Limited Energy)
**Focus:**  
Hypertrophy and muscle endurance.

**Format:**  
Perform 15‚Äì25 reps with lighter weights and higher volume, aiming for complete muscle exhaustion. Gradually increase weight by 5 lbs once 25 reps can be achieved, continuing until failure is unavoidable.

**Goal:**  
Push muscles to total fatigue, breaking them down to stimulate growth and endurance.

### Training Philosophy üìö
This training philosophy is inspired by the principles of [5x5 Stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/), [Joe DeFranco's](https://www.defrancostraining.com/) methods, [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner), and Barry Ross's [Underground Secrets to Faster Running](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Secrets-Faster-Running-Barry/dp/1411657357). These programs emphasize the importance of big compound lifts‚Äîsquats, deadlifts, and bench presses‚Äîand incorporate sprint training techniques to build explosive power and strength. Together, they provide a foundation for a disciplined, progressive, and effective approach to strength and athletic performance.

### Dynamic Warm-Ups
Before high-intensity sessions, I dedicate 10‚Äì15 minutes to:
- [Dynamic stretching routine.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w6oCquWGaDw)
- Band work.
- Foam rolling.
- Lacrosse ball mobility drills.
- [Mobility exercises.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSDLDhbacc)

### Off Days
On recovery days, I still incorporate movement:
- **Yoga:** 60-minute [sessions at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLy2rYHwUqY&list=PLGm_VqH9Les15RCoyAC7ORsr5kkFPERWe&pp=gAQBiAQB) to enhance flexibility, reduce tension, and improve recovery.
- **Sprints:** In summer, I perform speed drills and ladder exercises for 45 minutes weekly.

### What Isn‚Äôt Measured Isn‚Äôt Managed: The Importance of Tracking Workouts üìù
Logging your workouts is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to stay accountable and ensure consistent progress. Tracking allows you to measure where you‚Äôre at, identify trends, and make data-driven adjustments to your training.

I use Google Sheets to keep things simple. By logging key metrics like sets, reps, weights, rest times and overall load volume for the workout, I can easily compare progress month over month. This helps me see tangible improvements, identify plateaus, and adjust my plan accordingly.

Without tracking, it‚Äôs easy to forget details or rely on guesswork, which can slow progress. Logging your workouts not only keeps you accountable but also adds a sense of accomplishment when you look back and see how far you‚Äôve come. 

*"What isn‚Äôt measured isn‚Äôt managed.*  
Logging your workouts is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to stay accountable and ensure consistent progress.

**Why Track?**
- Measure performance trends.
- Identify plateaus.
- Make data-driven adjustments to training.

**How I Track:**  
I use Google Sheets to log key metrics such as:
- Sets
- Reps
- Weights
- Rest times
- Overall load volume

Tracking adds accountability and provides a sense of accomplishment when reviewing progress over time.

### The Role of Compound Movements
Compound lifts are essential for building overall strength and functional capacity. Inspired by the 5/3/1 program, my routine incorporates these key exercises:

- **Squats:** Total lower-body development, core engagement, and functional power.
- **Deadlifts:** Build posterior chain and overall body strength.
- **Bench Press:** Upper body strength and size.
- **Overhead Press:** Core and shoulder stability.
- **Pull-Ups and Dips:** Essential for building strength relative to body weight.

#### Key Principles:
- **Optimal Size:**  
  Maintaining 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 220 lbs, and 9‚Äì12% body fat to balance strength and health.
- **Minimizing Wear and Tear:**  
  Avoiding extreme calorie surpluses and excessive weight loads that strain the body.
- **Consistency:**  
  Not missing more than five days of training since age 15, even during illness.
- **Preparedness:**  
  Remaining physically powerful for heavy lifting, fast running, or enduring long activity bouts.

### A Resilient Lifestyle üõ°Ô∏è
This routine doesn‚Äôt just promote physical health but also enhances mental resilience. Despite years of intense physical demands, I rarely get sick, sleep deeply, and maintain energy levels that allow me to tackle each day with focus and high energy.

By optimizing my nutrition, adopting a rigorous yet sustainable training routine, and fostering discipline, I‚Äôve created a system that‚Äôs both effective and rewarding. My commitment to lifelong fitness is driven by a desire to be ready for anything life may throw at me‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs moving a heavy appliance on a weekend, defending myself in a dangerous situation, or even being prepared for a global conflict. Staying mentally sharp and physically capable isn‚Äôt just a goal; it‚Äôs a lifestyle that ensures I‚Äôm equipped to handle any challenge with confidence and resilience

### Football: The Foundation of My Discipline
My journey into fitness and optimization started on the football field, where my passion for training was born. Football wasn‚Äôt just a sport for me; it was a proving ground that shaped my mindset, built my work ethic, and laid the foundation for the discipline I carry into my life today.

**High School Football: Building the Foundation**
I entered high school at 6‚Äô1‚Äù and 165 lbs, a lanky kid with big dreams of making the football team. By the time I graduated, I had transformed into a 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 220-lb defensive powerhouse, setting records and earning accolades along the way. This transformation was no accident‚Äîit was the result of relentless effort and a commitment to strength training before it became mainstream among high school athletes.

### Key Milestones üèÜ

#### Breaking Records
I broke all defensive records and became the first player from Brandon to win Defensive Player of the Year in the Winnipeg Football League (WHSFL). Building on that success, I carried the momentum into the CJFL, where I set records as the league‚Äôs best defensive player and top defensive lineman.

#### Physical Dominance
Here‚Äôs a funny story: I once sent my  [highlight game footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-WjuLGGipo&pp=ygUYc3BlbmNlciByaWNoZSBoaWdobGlnaHRz) to the head coach of the Winnipeg Rifles CJFL team. Ten minutes later, I got a reply that simply said, "hahahahaha." A bit confused, I asked, "What‚Äôs so funny?" He replied, "You look like an adult playing with children."

### My Training Philosophy in High School
While many of my peers skipped strength training or didn‚Äôt take it seriously, I became obsessed with it. Inspired by programs like 5/3/1, I focused on the big compound lifts‚Äîsquats, deadlifts, bench press‚Äîand sprint training inspired by [Barry Ross‚Äôs Underground Secrets to Faster Running](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Secrets-Faster-Running-Barry/dp/1411657357). Every session was an opportunity to outdo myself, logging every lift and adding weight whenever I could.

### CJFL: Pushing the Limits
As my [football career advanced ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR_QwC9yalg&t=9s&pp=ygUYc3BlbmNlciByaWNoZSBoaWdobGlnaHRz), I pushed my body to its natural peak. In my prime years, I stood at a lean 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 260 lbs with athleticism to match:

- **Speed:** A 40-yard dash time of 4.7 seconds.
- **Strength:**
  - Bench press: 365 lbs
  - Deadlift: 610 lbs
  - Squat: 495 lbs

To sustain this level of performance, my life revolved around training and recovery:
- **Morning Conditioning:** Sprint training and conditioning drills at 4‚Äì5 AM.
- **Day Job:** A physically demanding 7‚Äì3 pipefitting job.
- **Evening Grind:** Strength training from 5‚Äì7 PM, followed by football practice from 8‚Äì9 PM.

I consumed an enormous 6,000 calories per day to fuel this lifestyle‚Äîan effort that was both expensive and exhausting. While this period marked the peak of my physical performance, it wasn‚Äôt sustainable in the long run.

### Lessons Learned From Football üß†

#### Bigger Isn‚Äôt Always Better
The larger and stronger you are, the more stress you place on your organs and overall health.

#### Strength Has Its Limits
Despite prioritizing proper form, managing my nutrition, and focusing on recovery, my joints, ligaments, and tendons couldn‚Äôt keep up with the increasing volume and demands. This eventually led to injuries, surgeries, and chronic pain.

#### Sustainability Matters
After football, I prioritized balancing peak performance with longevity and functionality.

#### Preparation Is Key
The mental and physical preparation I cultivated during this period remains a cornerstone of my daily life.

#### Working With a Team
Football taught me the value of collaboration, accountability, and shared goals. Each individual effort contributed to collective success, pushing me to be better not just for myself but for those around me. This lesson translates to life off the field as well, whether in a professional environment, family, or friendships.

#### The Importance of Losing
Competitive sports taught me resilience, humility, and learning from setbacks. Losing became less about defeat and more about growth, shaping my mindset for challenges on and off the field.

---

### A Sustainable Version of Peak Performance
My time in football motivated me to pursue a more sustainable version of peak performance. Now, I maintain a high level of strength relative to my body weight without the need for the extreme regimens I once followed.

Football instilled in me an obsession with being prepared‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs having the strength to lift heavy, the stamina to endure grueling tasks, or the resilience to face any challenge life throws my way. That passion, born on the field, continues to drive me forward every day.
