### Preface

The catalyst that led me to write this was the recent Canada-U.S. trade tensions, particularly the reaction to a potential 25% tariff from U.S. President Donald Trump. But the real issue isn’t the tariff itself—it’s how many Canadians are reacting, pointing fingers at Trump as if he alone is responsible for our economic struggles while ignoring the deeper, long-standing issues that put us in this vulnerable position.

The reality is, our challenges are not caused by any single foreign leader—they stem from within. Over the years, Canada has faced economic mismanagement, policies that have driven away investment, and an overreliance on government intervention. Trump didn’t block our pipelines. Trump didn’t cause half a trillion dollars in capital to leave Canada. Trump didn’t stall our GDP per capita for a decade. These are the consequences of our own decisions—from energy policies to taxation and economic priorities and continuous altruistic virtue-signaling delusions that have left us less competitive on the global stage.

At the same time, we’ve quietly accepted policies that increase our cost of living, such as a rising carbon tax and massive government borrowing, yet we react strongly to a trade negotiation tactic. Where is that same level of concern for the challenges we create for ourselves? We should be just as engaged in ensuring Canada remains strong, independent, and economically resilient as we are in reacting to external pressures.

And now, suddenly, we’re supposed to rally around a renewed sense of Canadian pride? Where was this national unity when it actually mattered? Just weeks ago, it was socially acceptable to [burn the Canadian flag in the streets in support of foreign wars.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKplgqcaNY) But when Canadians previously stood up for their own sovereignty, freedoms, and rights, they were labeled misogynists, racists, and extremists.  They were ostracized from their families, de-banked, outcasted from society, and treated like second-class citizens simply for defending individual liberties and national identity as enshrined in our Charter of Freedoms and Constitution. Now, those same people are expected to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in unity with the very institutions that vilified them? The hypocrisy is staggering.

This article isn’t about assigning blame—it’s about recognizing that if we want Canada to be strong, we must take responsibility for our own policies and direction. Challenges will always come from the outside, but our ability to handle them is determined by the strength we build from within. We need to focus on long-term solutions that encourage economic growth, national resilience, and self-sufficiency, rather than searching for external culprits.

Canada’s future is in our hands. If we want real change, it starts with accountability, informed decision-making, and a willingness to take responsibility. Let’s build a Canada that is strong, independent, and unapologetically prepared for whatever challenges come our way.


## Introduction

Once a global symbol of stability, prosperity, and personal freedom, Canada is now a cautionary tale of reckless leadership, unchecked government overreach, and societal decay. Since Justin Trudeau's Liberals took power in 2015, the country has spiraled into an economic and political fiasco, with its decline accelerating year after year. What was once a proud and resilient nation has become a fragile shell of its former self—drowning in debt, crippled by complacency, and increasingly unrecognizable to those who once believed in its promise.
The evidence is staggering: the economy is stagnant, with per-capita GDP growth at record lows while federal spending has skyrocketed by 75% in just eight years. Nearly a trillion dollars in new debt has shackled future generations, inflation reached a 40-year high, and the government's fiscal mismanagement has driven Canada into economic quicksand. Trudeau's regime—riddled with scandals, corruption, and ethical violations—has repeatedly evaded accountability, even shutting down Parliament when scrutiny became too intense.

But the problem runs deeper than economics. Freedoms have eroded at an alarming rate. The Trudeau government set a dangerous precedent in 2022 by invoking the Emergencies Act to crush peaceful protests, freezing citizens' bank accounts like an authoritarian dictatorship. Speech laws continue tightening, with proposed legislation aiming to police "online harms" under Orwellian pretenses, and mainstream media—propped up by government bailouts—parrots the official narrative without question. Public apathy and mass complacency have only emboldened the overreach, creating a passive, government-dependent populace that accepts decline rather than fights against it.

Meanwhile, a rapidly expanding welfare state has encouraged reliance on government support, eroding personal responsibility and draining ambition from the labor force. The government has created an entitlement culture where hard work is penalized, and dependency is rewarded. The consequences are clear: labor force participation is collapsing, businesses struggle to find workers, and the once-proud work ethic that built this nation is fading. Canadians feel it—polls show a majority now believe the country is "broken," yet many remain too paralyzed to demand meaningful change.

This isn't incompetence—it's a strategy. The rapid deterioration of Canada's economy, institutions, and national identity is not just a series of mistakes but the result of a deliberate, calculated effort to overload the system, strain public services, and manufacture crises to consolidate power. The fingerprints of the Cloward-Piven strategy are all over this mess—break the system, create chaos, and seize more control. Those behind the curtain—political elites, corporate interests, and globalist power brokers—stand to enrich themselves as the country descends further into dependency and disorder.

Societally, the public has become risk-averse, passive, and easily manipulated, shaped by years of mass formation psychosis, particularly during COVID-19. Groupthink has replaced critical thinking, and blind obedience to the government and media has weakened Canada's spirit of independence. Meanwhile, large-scale, rapid immigration—while sold as a necessity for growth—has placed enormous pressure on housing, wages, and social cohesion, further destabilizing the nation. National pride is declining, historical figures are being erased, and Canada's shared identity is crumbling. A country that forgets its past and disowns its heroes has no future.
Canada is not just broken—it is in freefall. Unless citizens wake up, demand change, and force a dramatic course correction—fiscal responsibility, restoration of freedoms, stronger national defense, and democratic reform that puts power back in the hands of the people—this country will be beyond saving. The plan to tear Canada down from the inside out is unfolding before our eyes. The time to act isn't tomorrow. It's now.

Between 2015 and 2024, the average price of a home in Canada increased from approximately [$413,563 to $705,600](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/national-price-map/), marking a [71% rise](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables) over the decade.

In Vancouver, bureaucracy and regulations add [$644,000](https://www.vancouverobserver.com/2024/03/20/vancouver-housing-costs-explained/) (50% of total cost) to a new home, while taxes and fees make up 31% of the price—making housing drastically more expensive.

#### **Rising Poverty**
Approximately 1 out of 4, ([25% of Canadians](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2021001/article/00002-eng.htm)) live below the poverty line, a figure much higher than previous estimates of 8%. 

#### **Suicide Rate**
Suicide deaths in Canada [increased by 8.6%](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310039201) since Liberal leadership, reaching [4,850 cases in just 2022](https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/suicide-stats-canada-provinces/)—the highest on record—with men accounting for nearly 75% of all suicides.

#### **Opioid-related Deaths**
[Opioid deaths in Canada skyrocketed by 187.5%](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/substance-related-harms/opioids-stimulants/) since 2016, with over [49,105 fatalities](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/national-report-apparent-opioid-related-deaths-released-march-2023.html) under Trudeau's leadership—[79% of 2024 deaths](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/opioids/data-surveillance-research.html) linked to fentanyl.

#### **Health Care**
Under Trudeau, healthcare spending hit a record [$372 billion](https://www.cihi.ca/en/national-health-expenditure-trends) (12.4% of GDP), yet Canada ranks [28th out of 30](https://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance/) for doctors, [27th for MRI access](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/system-features/how-does-canada-compare), and [1.3 million Canadians](https://www.cihi.ca/en/emergency-department-wait-times-in-canada-continuing-to-rise) left ERs untreated due to wait times.

In the fiscal year 2022–2023, a record 17,032 Canadians died while awaiting medical procedures, marking a five-year high. Between 2018 and 2024, [over 74,000 Canadians died on waiting lists for various health services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to3-_GqCCPk). *Atleast it's free! Right?*


#### **Homelessness**

## Economic Collapse: Debt, Stagnation, and the Vanishing Canadian Dream

Canada's economy isn't just struggling—it's imploding. Years of reckless spending, bloated bureaucracy, and misguided policies have left the nation drowning in debt, plagued by stagnation, and crushed under the weight of soaring costs.

### A Nation Drowning in Debt

The numbers are horrifying: Canada's federal debt has more than doubled under Trudeau's Liberals, skyrocketing from $616 billion in 2015 to a staggering $1.23 trillion by 2024—a level of fiscal irresponsibility that took all previous governments 150 years to accumulate (Prince Albert Daily Herald). This debt binge isn't just abstract government mismanagement—it comes with brutal consequences:

- Over $1 billion per week is now being burned on interest payments alone—money that could have funded healthcare, infrastructure, or tax relief. Instead, it vanishes into a black hole of financial incompetence.
- Every Canadian child is born shackled with tens of thousands of dollars in federal debt, a generational theft that will haunt future taxpayers.

- The government's debt addiction has set the stage for crippling tax hikes and service cuts, ensuring that today's youth will be paying off Trudeau's spending spree for decades.

This is not just fiscal recklessness—it's economic sabotage.

### Why National Debt Matters: A Quick Breakdown

**For those who don't follow economics or political policy, here's what you need to know:**

1. **Massive Debt = Higher Taxes**
   - You and your kids will pay more in taxes for decades just to cover interest

2. **Essential Services at Risk**
   - Money that should go to healthcare, infrastructure, or tax relief is instead wasted on debt payments

3. **Generational Theft**
   - Every Canadian child is born already owing tens of thousands in debt they had no say in

4. **No Way Out**
   - The debt is so large that escaping it without major economic pain (tax hikes, service cuts, or inflation) is nearly impossible

5. **It's Only Getting Worse**
   - The government doubled the debt in less than a decade, faster than in all of Canada's history

### Where Has the Money Gone?

Where has all this money gone? Ask yourself—has your life actually improved over the past decade? With an extra $659 billion of taxpayer money spent, you'd expect to see some tangible benefits, right? 

Yet, there's nothing. No major improvements, declining services, no relief—just soaring costs and dwindling opportunities. That's because this money isn't coming back to you. It's been squandered, funneled into waste, corruption, and self-enrichment for the political elite. 

This isn't just incompetence—it's a direct attack on your financial future and that of your children.

## GDP Flatlines: Canada's Economy is Going Nowhere

While Trudeau's government hemorrhages cash, Canada's economic growth has flatlined.

- In 2023, real GDP crawled forward at just 1.1%—one of the worst performances outside the 2020 crash, and the weakest since 2016. For comparison, Canada once enjoyed growth rates of 3-4% before Liberal mismanagement took hold.
- Worse still, due to the country's record-breaking population surge, GDP per capita is in freefall. By late 2023, real output per person was 2.5% below its pre-pandemic level—meaning the average Canadian is poorer today than they were years ago (Canada's GDP per capita: Perspectives on the Return to Trend).
- The average Canadian now earns less than the lowest-paid workers in Mississippi while facing a higher cost of living, making life in Canada less affordable than in the poorest U.S. state—a shocking collapse of economic prosperity.

Canada isn't just stagnating—it's actively regressing.

![Alt text](/assets/images/canada/gdp.jpeg)

## The Canadian Dollar: A Symbol of Decline 

Nothing reflects Canada's waning economic clout more than the collapsing value of its currency. Once flirting with parity with the U.S. dollar in the early 2010s, the loonie has plunged to 69 cents USD—its lowest levels in decades (St. Albert News). In January 2025, it even dipped below 69¢ intraday, signaling a profound lack of global confidence in Canada's economy.

- A weaker dollar erodes purchasing power, making everything from groceries to vacations more expensive.
- Imported goods—especially food and electronics—now cost significantly more, hammering Canadian households already struggling with inflation.
- International markets see Canada as a fiscal dumpster fire, which is why our currency is tanking.
- This is what happens when a government prioritizes ideology over economic reality.

![Alt text](/assets/images/canada/loonie.PNG)

## The Inflation Inferno: A 40-Year High and Lasting Damage

Canadians have suffered through the worst inflation crisis in four decades—a direct result of government mismanagement.

- Inflation peaked at a catastrophic 8.1% in June 2022—a level unseen since the 1980s (Research to Insights).
- Skyrocketing prices slashed real incomes, meaning even as wages nominally increased, purchasing power collapsed.
- Essentials like food, fuel, and housing became unaffordable, punishing working-class Canadians the most.
- In major cities like Toronto, the situation is even more critical. In 2023, owning a home in Toronto required 73.1% of a household's pre-tax income, making it one of the least affordable cities in the World.

Though inflation has since declined, the damage is permanent. Higher baseline prices mean Canadians are stuck paying more for necessities indefinitely, while interest rates remain elevated—crippling homeowners and small businesses alike.

## Housing: The Death of the Canadian Dream 🏡

The Canadian housing crisis is a national disaster—one engineered by government policy failures.

- Home prices soared over 50% during the pandemic, making ownership unattainable for young Canadians. Despite recent corrections, prices remain absurdly high, with the average home now well beyond reach for most middle-class families.

- Household debt has exploded, with Canadians now owing $1.85 for every $1.00 of disposable income—one of the highest debt-to-income ratios in the world (Housing, Wealth, and Debt: How Young Canadians are Adapting).

- At 185% debt-to-income, Canada has the highest household debt ratio in the G7, making its citizens more vulnerable to economic shocks than any of its peer nations.

And it's not just homeowners who are suffering.

- Rent has skyrocketed due to record-low vacancy rates and a housing supply shortage worsened by mass immigration policies with no supporting infrastructure.

- Homelessness is surging, with shelters overflowing and encampments growing in major cities. We now have 235,000 people living on the streets, out of an estimated 2,000,000 unhoused, which was only 93,529 in 2021.

- Poverty Rates: 1 out of 4 (25%) Canadians are now below the poverty line. Up from 8% in 2014 when liberals assumed office.

- Food Bank Usage:  Record High Visits: March 2024 saw over 2 million food bank visits, marking a 6% increase from 2023 and a staggering 90% surge since 2019.

- Young Canadians, once hopeful for a middle-class future, are increasingly giving up on ever owning a home. Homeownership rates are plummeting among those under 35, creating a permanent class divide between those who bought early and those now permanently locked out.

![Alt text](/assets/images/canada/homeprice.jpg)

**This isn't an accident—it's a policy failure.**

Instead of addressing the housing crisis, the government deliberately fueled the fire, keeping interest rates at record lows for too long, flooding the market with demand via unchecked immigration, and failing to push for real housing development solutions. The result? Sky-high costs, crippling debt, and a generation financially ruined before they even start.

## This is Not Mismanagement—It's Deliberate Destruction

Make no mistake—Canada's economic collapse is not just the result of bad decisions. It is a coordinated strategy of economic destabilization, designed to create dependency, weaken the middle class, and consolidate power.

- The [Cloward-Piven strategy](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward-Piven_strategy) is in full effect: overwhelm the system with debt, social spending, and crises to manufacture a need for more government control.
- The expansion of the welfare state has replaced ambition with dependency, ensuring that more Canadians rely on government handouts instead of economic opportunity.
- The destruction of the housing market, currency stability, and purchasing power forces the average citizen into perpetual financial servitude.

Canadians now face a stark reality: a future of higher taxes, higher interest rates, fewer opportunities, and less prosperity—unless there is a radical course correction.

## Canada's Birth Rate Collapse: The Cost of a Broken Economy

Canada's birth rate has fallen to 1.33 children per woman, far below the 2.1 replacement level—a demographic disaster in the making. The reason? Young Canadians can't afford families.

### Why Aren't Canadians Having Kids?

- Housing Is Unaffordable – 78% of young Canadians say homeownership is out of reach, so they delay or abandon family plans.
- Financial Instability – Soaring taxes, inflation, and stagnant wages make raising kids a financial risk.
Delayed Marriage, Fewer Kids – First-time motherhood now averages 31 years old, up from 26 in the 1990s, meaning smaller families.
- No Confidence in the Future – High taxes, economic decline, and political instability make parenthood seem reckless.

### What Happens Next?

- Taxpayers Will Be Crushed – In 1970, 7 workers supported each retiree. Today, it's 3.4:1—by 2050, it will be 2:1, meaning higher taxes and gutted pensions.

### **⏸️ Let's pause for a quick moment, let me put this stat into prospective for you**

If Canada's pension system were to maintain the same worker-to-retiree ratio as today (3.4:1) while adjusting for the projected 2:1 ratio by 2050, the expected retirement age would need to rise to **110 years old—a completely unfeasible scenario. This highlights the impossibility of sustaining pensions without massive tax hikes, benefit cuts, or a dramatic reversal in birth rates.**

Now, this begs the obvious follow up question, **"why the hell would you go to work?"**

Exactly—who in their right mind would willingly buy into a rigged system where the promised reward will never come? If the retirement age must skyrocket to 110 years old to keep pensions afloat, then the entire concept of "working hard today for a secure future" is a lie.

**Why would anyone keep paying into a pension they'll never collect?**

- Why work for a system that demands more from you while giving less in return?
- Why participate in an economy that guarantees you'll work until you drop dead?
- Imagine the insane scenario that you are likely to die while at work.

At some point, people will opt out—whether that means working under the table, moving to lower-tax countries, or embracing self-sufficiency outside the government's grasp. A collapsing pension system destroys the incentive to contribute. If young workers know they'll never retire, expect a mass refusal to participate—more underground economies, more tax avoidance, and a total breakdown in trust between citizens and the state.

- **Labor Shortages Will Wreck the Economy** – Fewer workers mean stalled industries, slower growth, and a shrinking tax base.
- **Healthcare Costs Will Explode** – By 2050, healthcare spending could surpass 20% of GDP, leading to brutal rationing, longer wait time or outright inability to provide care.
- **Real Estate Bubble Will Pop** – If young Canadians can't afford families, who will buy homes? Canada risks a Japan-style housing collapse which resulted because of their 1 child policy.

### Immigration Won't Fix This

The government's "solution" is mass immigration, but it's a short-term patch:

- **Immigrants Age Too** – They eventually retire and require the same services.
- **Birth Rates Drop After One Generation** – Immigrant families quickly adopt Canada's low fertility trends.
- **Wage Gaps Keep the Deficit Growing** – Many immigrants work low-wage jobs, contributing less in taxes while relying on government services.

**The Bottom Line**

Canada's collapsing birth rate isn't a choice—it's a forced decision driven by an unlivable economy. If things don't change, the next generation won't exist to fix it.

## Canada's Descent into Authoritarianism: Government Overreach, Censorship, and Bureaucratic Bloat

The Liberal government hasn't just failed—it has actively eroded freedoms, silenced dissent, and expanded state control to an unprecedented degree. What was once a country that championed liberty is now a nation where the government freezes bank accounts, censors speech, and crushes opposition with brute force.

### The Emergencies Act: Canada's Darkest Chapter
In 2022, Trudeau did what no Prime Minister had ever done before—he invoked the [Emergencies Act](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/emergencies-urgences.html) to silence peaceful protest. The [Freedom Convoy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/emergencies-act-inquiry-report-1.6780051), a demonstration against draconian pandemic policies, was met not with dialogue but with the full force of the state.

- [Bank accounts of ordinary Canadians were frozen](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/at-least-76-financial-accounts-frozen-since-emergencies-act-invoked-1.5788435)—not criminals, not terrorists, but citizens who dared to donate to a cause the government disapproved of.
- A [federal judge later ruled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/emergencies-act-federal-court-ruling-1.7093594) the move "unreasonable and ultra vires"—there was no national emergency, meaning the government knowingly trampled Charter rights for political convenience.
- To this day, [Trudeau defends his actions](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-emergencies-act-ruling-appeal/) and is appealing the ruling—doubling down on the most authoritarian overreach in modern Canadian history.
- The message was clear: challenge the regime, and you'll be treated like an enemy of the state.

### State-Controlled Media: Bought and Paid For

- Freedom of the press? Not in Canada. In 2018, the Trudeau government [bailed out select media outlets](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/funding/canadian-periodical-fund.html) with [$595 million in subsidies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/journalists-question-media-bailout-1.5147761), ensuring that the press stays compliant.
- "Friendly" media get funding—critics get left in the cold.
- Trudeau even [joked that journalists go easy on him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpY9vJuLmxU) because "we pay them $600 million." Not so funny when it's true.
- The CBC, already propped up by over [$1 billion annually](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-subsidy-1.6668889), has become little more than a state propaganda arm.
- The result? A media landscape reluctant to challenge the government while Canadians wonder whether they're getting the truth or government-scripted narratives.

### Bill C-11: The Internet Censorship Bill

- Not content with buying the media, Trudeau's government is now coming for your speech online. [Bill C-11](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-11/royal-assent), disguised as a way to promote "Canadian content," is really just a tool for state control over what you see and say.
- The [CRTC now has power](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/) over YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms, deciding what content gets promoted or buried.
- [Critics warn](https://openmedia.org/article/item/bill-c-11-will-harm-canadian-digital-creators) it opens the door to online censorship, allowing bureaucrats to manipulate search results, silence dissent, and dictate what is "acceptable" speech.
- Even [liberal-leaning internet advocates oppose it](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/06/bill-c-11-risks-undermining-canadas-creator-economy-and-its-international-trade-obligations/), calling it a dangerous step toward government-controlled digital spaces.
- With [more speech laws](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/harmful-online-content.html) on the way targeting "misinformation" and "online harms," Canada is marching toward a future where only state-approved opinions are safe.

### Bureaucratic Bloat: The Ever-Expanding Nanny State

- As freedoms shrink, government grows. Under Trudeau, the federal workforce has [exploded by 40%](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics.html), ballooning from 257,000 employees in 2015 to over 357,000 by 2023.
- Government spending is at [record highs](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/federal-government-spending-in-canada), but services haven't improved—passports take months, airports are chaos, and public sector strikes hold the country hostage.
- Ottawa now employs more people than ever, yet private sector workers foot the bill while drowning in red tape.
- [Public sector unions](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/topics/collective-bargaining.html) are bigger and more militant, demanding more while delivering less to the people paying their salaries.
- A bloated bureaucracy serves itself—not Canadians.

### A Weak, Corrupt, and Divisive Government

Beyond authoritarianism, Trudeau's leadership is defined by scandal, corruption, and arrogance.

- The SNC-Lavalin scandal—Trudeau interfered in a criminal case to protect his political allies.
- The WE Charity fiasco—hundreds of millions funneled to an organization with ties to the Prime Minister's family.
- Multiple ethics violations—Trudeau has been found guilty more than any other sitting Prime Minister in history.
Instead of fixing Canada's crumbling economy, broken healthcare system, or skyrocketing cost of living, Trudeau's government focuses on:
- Censoring critics.
- Demonizing opponents as extremists.
- Pushing vanity projects like securing UN seats.

When challenged, the reflex is control, not correction—silence dissent, spin the narrative, and tighten the leash on Canadians.

## Canada's National Security Failure: A Country Ripe for Exploitation

While our government obsesses over virtue signaling and expanding state control, it has completely neglected national security. Canada is defenseless, under-equipped, and utterly dependent on the American shield to prevent foreign powers from pillaging our land and resources.

### A Military in Freefall: Weak, Undermanned, and Outdated

Canada's military isn't just underfunded—it's in crisis.

- [78% of Canadian military personnel](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/health-of-caf-2022.html) are classified as obese or overweight—a damning reflection of recruitment struggles and declining physical standards.
- We have the [lowest military participation](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2023/03/pdf/230329-def-exp-2022-en.pdf) in the G7, making us a security liability among allies.
- We don't have nuclear deterrence, while potential adversaries stockpile warheads.
- Our tank fleet? [Fewer than 10 operational](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/procurement/leopard-2-tank-fleet.html). In a real conflict, we'd be steamrolled.

### We Talk Tough, But We Cower Under the U.S. Shield 🛡️

Canadians love to badmouth Americans, claiming moral superiority while hiding behind their military protection. The harsh truth? Without the U.S.:

- Canada would be invaded, plundered, and enslaved. Our resources—oil, minerals, water, food—are too valuable for hostile nations to ignore.
- We have [no defense infrastructure](https://www.cgai.ca/canadas_defence_capabilities_gap)—no serious air force, no credible navy, no meaningful deterrence.
- A foreign power would walk in unchallenged, strip the land, and put us to work in labor camps.

### Ignoring History: The Delusional Canadian Mindset

Why do we **lock our doors at night?** Because the world is dangerous.

Why do we **build armies?** Because history proves that strong nations survive—weak ones are conquered.

But Canada refuses to learn.

- Defense spending is barely [1.3% of GDP](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_197050.htm)—far below NATO's 2% commitment.
- A [leaked Pentagon report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-canada-defence-spending-1.6872128) exposed Trudeau telling NATO Canada will NEVER meet the 2% target. Translation: We expect the U.S. to clean up our mess.
- We are [16,000 troops short](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/caf-recruitment.html) of full strength—units are undermanned, morale is collapsing, and recruitment is failing.

### An Army That Can't Fight

- [Less than half of Canada's fighter jets](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/equipment/fighter-jets.html) are mission-ready.
- The navy operates at just [46% capacity](https://www.cgai.ca/canadas_naval_fleet_capability.html).
- Our army can barely deploy [54% of its forces](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/transition-materials/defence-101/2020/03/defence-101/state-of-caf.html) at any given time.
- Our [CF-18 fighter jets are older than their pilots](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/procurement/fighter-jets/future-fighter-capability-project.html).

This is a national disgrace.

### The Arctic, Cyber Attacks, and Real-World Threats

Meanwhile, our enemies are watching.

- [Russian bombers and drones](https://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/news/arctic-air-defence.page) are regularly intercepted near our airspace.
- [China is waging cyber warfare](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/cyber-threat-assessment-2023), infiltrating our infrastructure and politics.
- The [Arctic is up for grabs](https://www.cgai.ca/arctic_security), and Canada has almost no ability to defend its vast northern territory.

We aren't just weak—we are broadcasting our weakness to the world.

### What Needs to Happen—NOW

- Massively increase defense spending to at least 2% of GDP.
- Expand and modernize our military, from fighter jets to ground forces.
- Restore national pride in service—better pay, recruitment incentives, and real leadership.
- Stop assuming America will save us—because if they don't, Canada as we know it will cease to exist.

Soft power is a fantasy. Real nations defend themselves. Canada is living on borrowed time, relying on the goodwill of the U.S. and blind luck.
History is clear—weak nations get conquered. Canada is weak. What happens next is inevitable unless we change course now.

## The Death of Canadian Resilience: A Nation of Obedience, Weakness, and Dependency

Canada wasn't built by weak, spineless rule-followers—it was built by pioneers, warriors, and risk-takers who fought for their freedoms and thrived on self-reliance. Yet today, that spirit is all but dead.

We are no longer a country of bold innovators, tough workers, or fearless thinkers. We have become a nation of obedient sycophants, waiting for government handouts, terrified of speaking freely, and utterly reliant on a system that does not serve us.

### Self-Censorship: Canadians Have Been Broken

A nation that fears speaking the truth is a nation already conquered. And make no mistake—Canadians are afraid.
- [52% openly admit they self-censor](https://www.jccf.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-02-Free-to-speak-report.pdf), afraid of being mobbed, fired, or socially exiled for daring to say something "offensive."
- Universities, once bastions of free thought, have become [ideological prisons](https://campusfreedomindex.ca/2023-campus-freedom-index/) where students and professors live in fear of cancellation.
- Dissent is not debated—it's destroyed. Say the wrong thing, and your job, reputation, and livelihood are wiped out.
- Now in Canada, under [Bill C-16](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/royal-assent), simply misgendering can be ruled a [human rights violation](https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/en/complaints/what-discrimination), leading to fines, forced policy changes, and legal penalties, with some rulings ordering up to [$30,000 in damages](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-because-gender-identity-and-gender-expression/9-remedies)—a chilling precedent where speech can cost you tens of thousands of dollars.

Canadians no longer challenge authority—we comply. We kneel. We beg for permission. We have lost the backbone that made us great.

## Entrepreneurship is Dying, and With It, Our Future

Canada used to be a country of dreamers and builders—now, we fear risk, resent success, and worship safety.

- Business investment in Canada is [among the lowest](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/business-investment-in-canada-falls-far-behind-other-industrialized-countries) in the developed world.
- [Venture capital and startups are anemic](https://www.cvca.ca/research-insight/market-reports), as innovators flee to countries that actually reward ambition.
- Young Canadians [dream of government jobs](https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/public-service-employment-canada)—'safe", stable, lifeless careers where they'll never have to think for themselves.

Without bold entrepreneurs, Canada will become a nation of bureaucrats, tax collectors, and passive wage slaves, watching as the rest of the world leaves us behind.

Talk to any wealthy or successful Canadian today, and you'll hear the same thing: **"Make enough to escape."** Either leave Canada entirely or earn enough to buy secluded land far away from the collapsing cities. The dream isn't to build here—it's to get out before it gets worse.

When I was working on my U.S. residency visa through my business, I spoke with one of Canada's top cross-border tax experts and asked him how many Canadians were applying for visas or renouncing their residency or citizenship. His response was staggering—he used to get a call **"maybe once every three months. Now, he gets over 50 a week.**

And just as this exodus ramps up, the Canadian government conveniently stopped tracking how many people are leaving. Gee, I wonder why.

Canada is facing a brain drain crisis as its most productive, skilled, and wealthy individuals flee the country. When entrepreneurs, investors, high-income earners, and job creators leave, they take their capital, businesses, and expertise with them—gutting the economy from the top down. Fewer innovators mean fewer jobs, less investment, and a shrinking tax base, forcing the remaining population to shoulder higher taxes and a declining standard of living. Without its best and brightest, Canada risks becoming a nation of bureaucrats and dependents, watching as its economic engine grinds to a halt.

Imagine you're a doctor—you've spent years in school, racked up hundreds of thousands in student debt, and finally started earning a real paycheck at 38 years old. Now, you have two choices: stay in Canada, where over **51% of your paycheck vanishes in taxes**, forcing you to work half the year for free while being worked to the bone in a collapsing healthcare system, or head to the U.S., where you keep hundreds of thousands more of your money, enjoy a 50% lower cost of living, and never have to endure sub-zero winters again.

**What exactly is Canada offering to keep its top talent? The answer is simple: nothing.** We are not competitive, and until that changes, the exodus will only continue.

## Government Dependency: The Great Canadian Addiction

Nothing has poisoned the national psyche more than the belief that the government will always save you.

- [20 million Canadians](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cerb-statistics.html)—more than half the adult population—took COVID handouts.
- [Over 50% of adults](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/government-support-and-dependence-during-pandemic.pdf) rely on some form of government income.
- Today, cries for [universal basic income](https://www.ubiworks.ca/post/majority-of-canadians-support-basic-income), permanent subsidies, and endless social programs grow louder—even as debt skyrockets and the country teeters on the edge of collapse.

This entitlement mindset has rotted our work ethic. Why struggle, why innovate, why fight for success, when the government will hand you just enough to survive?

Again, [this is by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward%E2%80%93Piven_strategy). The more dependent the population, the easier it is to control.

### A Weak, Submissive Nation Cannot Lead

A country that self-censors, obeys without question, fears risk, and depends entirely on the state is a country in its death throes. This isn't a nation that can stand on the world stage—it's one that will be steamrolled by history.

### Canada's Immigration Disaster: A System on the Brink of Collapse

Canada was built on immigration, but what was once a strength is now a crisis. The government has recklessly opened the floodgates, pushing immigration to [unprecedented levels](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2023-2025.html) without any plan to handle the consequences. The result? A country drowning in a [housing crisis](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/housing-data), overwhelmed healthcare system, crumbling infrastructure, and rising resentment.

### The Numbers Don't Lie—This Is Unsustainable

- In 2022, Canada admitted a [record-breaking 431,645 new permanent residents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/02/canada-welcomes-historic-number-of-newcomers-in-2022.html), surpassing all previous records. By 2025, that number is set to hit [500,000 per year](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2023-2025.html).
- But that's only half the story—when you count [temporary residents, international students, and work permits](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230927/dq230927a-eng.htm), over 1 million people entered Canada in 2022 alone.
- Our population growth hit [3.2% in 2023](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230927/dq230927b-eng.htm), the highest in the developed world—double what's sustainable. If this pace continues, Canada's population will double in just two decades.

This is not normal. It's a social experiment forced onto Canadians without their consent, and we are already watching it fail.

![Alt text](/assets/images/canada/temp.png)

### Healthcare is Buckling Under the Pressure

- Canada already has some of the [worst wait times in the developed world](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/waiting-your-turn-wait-times-for-health-care-in-canada-2023)—the median wait for specialist care in 2023 was [28 weeks](https://www.cihi.ca/en/wait-times-for-priority-procedures-in-canada).
- [Millions can't even find a family doctor](https://www.cma.ca/news-releases/nearly-5-million-canadians-without-family-doctor), and [emergency rooms are at capacity](https://www.cihi.ca/en/emergency-department-wait-times-in-canada-continuing-to-rise) across the country.
- More people means more strain on hospitals, but we aren't [building nearly enough clinics](https://www.cma.ca/news/canadas-health-care-crisis-by-numbers) or [training enough doctors](https://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/health-policy/physician-employment-study-e) to keep up.
 - In the fiscal year 2022–2023, a record 17,032 Canadians died while awaiting medical procedures, marking a five-year high. Between 2018 and 2024, [over 74,000 Canadians died on waiting lists for various health services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to3-_GqCCPk).

This isn't about blaming immigrants—it's about the government forcing an immigration surge without building the necessary infrastructure to support it.

### A Public Backlash is Brewing

Canadians aren't buying the government's excuses anymore.

- A [2024 Leger poll](https://leger360.com/surveys/immigration-in-canada/) found [60% of Canadians](https://angusreid.org/immigration-population-growth-housing-health-care/) believe we are bringing in too many immigrants, too fast—a complete reversal of our once-proud immigration consensus.
- Even [Trudeau's own Immigration Minister admitted](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/miller-immigration-levels-1.7080451) immigration will be the defining issue of the next election as public outrage grows.
- People aren't stupid. They see housing becoming unaffordable, hospitals being overwhelmed, schools running out of space, and cities becoming unlivable.

### The Government's Solution? Ignore the Problem

- Instead of moderating immigration, the Liberals are [doubling down](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/01/an-immigration-system-for-canadas-future.html), chasing GDP numbers without regard for the strain on society.
- They refuse to acknowledge that [rampant immigration fuels inflation](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/11/staff-analytical-note-2023-19/), drives up rent, and exacerbates wage stagnation.
- Meanwhile, the [Bank of Canada has explicitly stated](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2024/01/monetary-policy-report-2024-1/) that mass immigration is complicating inflation control.

### The Path Forward: Immigration Needs a Reality Check

1. [Slow down immigration levels](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/canadas-immigration-policy-is-disconnected-from-its-employment-needs) until infrastructure catches up. Canada should not be adding a million people per year when we don't have the housing or healthcare to support them.
2. Focus on [skilled immigration](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html) that actually fills labor shortages—not just a flood of new arrivals with no jobs lined up.
3. [Massively ramp up housing](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/research-reports/accelerate-supply/housing-shortages-canada-solving-affordability-crisis) and infrastructure investment—if we're going to bring in newcomers, we need to ensure they aren't being set up for failure.
4. Reintroduce [democratic accountability](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/CIMM)—immigration policy should be based on what's best for Canadians, not just GDP headlines or political virtue-signaling.

Canada's immigration policy has become a reckless, unsustainable disaster that is eroding quality of life for everyone—newcomers and existing Canadians alike. If we don't rein this in immediately, expect housing to become even more unaffordable, public services to collapse further, and resentment to boil over.

Canada should welcome immigrants—but responsibly, not recklessly. Right now, our government is choosing chaos over competence. The longer we let this spiral, the harder it will be to fix.

## Cultural Assassination: The Death of Canadian Identity

Once a nation of unparalleled economic strength, national unity, and cultural pride, Canada now stands at a crossroads. What was once a country built on perseverance, shared values, and the pursuit of greatness is being systematically dismantled. We are not merely witnessing a cultural shift—we are experiencing a full-scale cultural assassination. This is not progress; this is national erosion, an intentional dismantling of our identity under the deceptive banners of unchecked multiculturalism, historical revisionism, and radical policies that undermine our sovereignty.

### The Systematic Erasure of Canadian Heritage

Canada’s foundational symbols—once revered and honored—are now under relentless attack. Statues of the very leaders who built this country, such as Sir John A. Macdonald, have been defaced and torn down with impunity. City councils debate renaming schools and streets, stripping away the memory of those who shaped our nation. Canada Day, once a proud celebration of our unity, is now vilified as a reminder of supposed historical sins, with major cities canceling or downplaying festivities. Meanwhile, institutions push for the [phasing out of Christmas](https://thepostmillennial.com/canadian-school-cancels-christmas-to-hold-spring-concert-instead?#google_vignette), a holiday that has been a pillar of Canadian culture for generations, in favor of generic “winter celebrations.”

History is not meant to be rewritten but understood. A nation that refuses to acknowledge both its triumphs and its flaws is doomed to repeat its mistakes. Instead of learning from our past and using it to strengthen our national character, we are erasing the experiences that shaped us. Canada's history is complex, filled with both achievements and failures, yet it is these very struggles that have defined our collective identity. The relentless effort to judge historical figures by modern standards fails to recognize that history is a continuum of progress, and the lessons we derive from it are invaluable.

Consider the numbers: in 2021, a survey by Leger found that 51% of Canadians felt that their national identity was eroding. Additionally, 67% of respondents expressed concern over Canada’s increasing political correctness at the expense of tradition. These are not fringe fears; they are the sentiments of a growing silent majority tired of being told that their history, pride, and values are shameful relics.

### The War on Patriotism: A Nation Taught to Hate Itself

Instead of fostering unity, our educational institutions and media propagate a self-loathing narrative, one that paints Canada solely as a colonial oppressor rather than a nation of opportunity, resilience, and innovation. Children are no longer taught to appreciate the sacrifices made to build this country; instead, they are conditioned to view Canada as an irredeemable villain. The Canadian flag, once waved with pride, is now replaced with pride flags, while the National flag is now spit on and [burned in protests without consequence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKplgqcaNY)

Patriotism—the backbone of any strong nation—has been rebranded as dangerous nationalism. The idea that one can love their country while acknowledging its imperfections is dismissed. This binary view of history denies the fact that Canadian values, such as democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights, were forged through difficult struggles and hard-won victories. Those who fought for the country, whether in war or through civic leadership, are increasingly being vilified rather than honored.

What has been the result? A 2022 study from the Angus Reid Institute found that only 26% of young Canadians (aged 18-34) feel a deep sense of pride in their national identity. Compare this to older generations, where over 70% once held an unwavering belief in Canada’s greatness. The deliberate erosion of national pride is not an accident—it is an agenda-driven movement designed to weaken our social fabric.

### Unchecked Immigration: The Death of National Cohesion

Canada’s immigration system was once the envy of the world, built on the principle that newcomers would integrate, respect Canadian laws, and contribute meaningfully to society. But today, we are seeing the opposite: an unregulated influx of individuals who neither assimilate nor show allegiance to the country that welcomed them. Loose policies have opened the floodgates to exploiters rather than contributors.

Reports have surfaced of over 50,000 newcomers pretending to be students, paying for Canadian student visas without ever attending a class, all with the intent of exploiting loopholes to enter Canada without meeting proper requirements. Many of these individuals operate in underground economies, contributing neither to education nor society. Crime rates among non-citizens are rising, yet deportation remains an anomaly “radical” rather than a standard response. 

In 2023 alone, 38% of violent crime cases in major cities like Toronto involved foreign nationals or non-permanent residents. Meanwhile, a staggering 60% of immigrants admitted in the past five years have yet to secure full-time employment, relying instead on taxpayer-funded social programs.

### A Broken Justice System: Protecting Criminals Over Citizens

Law-abiding Canadians are being forced to live in increasingly unsafe communities. Our justice system, weakened by political correctness, prioritizes slaps on wrists over consequences, leading to repeat offenders walking free. Violent criminals are granted bail within hours, and deportation of those who abuse the system and are not even Canadian residents, is non-existent.

**Few examples:**

- Several weeks ago in Manitoba, Canada, a semi-truck driver was involved in a fatal collision that resulted in the deaths of a mother and her eight-year-old daughter. Following the accident, the driver was taken to the hospital for treatment and subsequently released. Authorities later issued a Canada-wide arrest warrant for the driver, but he could not be located [because he fled to his home country.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/winnipeg/article/manitoba-rcmp-issue-canada-wide-warrant-for-ontario-semi-driver-charged-in-deadly-crash/)
- Carjackings have surged to unprecedented levels, with thousands of stolen vehicles being shipped overseas annually. Organized crime groups exploit weak border security and lenient prosecution policies, making Canada a prime target for international car theft rings.
- Ontario Provincial Police, and other Greater Toronto Area police services announced the results of an extensive auto theft investigation. The operation led to 124 arrests, [749 criminal charges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqNzoyv4Lgc), and the recovery of over 170 stolen vehicles valued at more than $10 million. The investigation targeted criminal networks involved in violent auto thefts, home invasions, and other non-violent vehicle theft incidents. 
- In [October 2024](https://apnews.com/article/canada-drug-bust-lab-c0faf8130a9859db772b8c5fe88cc745), Canadian authorities dismantled the country's largest and most sophisticated illicit drug "super lab" in Falkland, British Columbia, linked to transnational organized crime. The operation led to the seizure of 54 kilograms of fentanyl, 390 kilograms of methamphetamine, significant amounts of precursor chemicals, and smaller quantities of cocaine, MDMA, and cannabis. Additionally, 89 firearms, including handguns, AR-15-style rifles, and submachine guns, as well as explosives, ammunition, silencers, high-capacity magazines, body armor, and approximately $500,000 in cash were confiscated. Gaganpreet Randhawa was arrested and faces multiple drug and firearms-related charges.
- In [2023 Pearson Airport gold heist](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/05/09/suspect-gold-heist-arrested-pearson/), in which criminals successfully stole over $20 million in gold and other valuables. Despite the magnitude of the theft, the perpetrators faced minimal consequences, highlighting the incompetence of our law enforcement in dealing with high-profile crimes.

The reality is clear: Canada’s justice system is a revolving door for criminals. The “catch and release” approach allows offenders to be arrested, processed, and released on bail within hours—often leading to reoffending before ever facing trial. Repeat offenders know that they face little to no real punishment, emboldening them to commit further crimes.

I encourage you to conduct a quick online search for “recent Canadian drug bust” and see for yourself how many of these cases involve individuals who are not Canadian residents—people who contribute nothing in taxes yet profit from and fuel the destruction of our communities. Our nation is being exploited, and lives are being lost due to weak border security and a legal system that fails to protect its own citizens.

From a criminal's perspective, **Canada is a goldmine.** You reap all the benefits—tax-free cash earnings from illegal activities, unrestricted entry into the country, and a justice system that practically invites exploitation. If you get caught, you’re released on bail, and before facing any real consequences, you can simply book a flight home. No penalties, no deterrents—just endless opportunity.

And as word spreads, why wouldn’t criminals from around the world flock to Canada? We’re a wealthy nation with a lax approach to crime, skyrocketing addiction rates, and a legal system that prioritizes political correctness over justice. For criminals, it’s an obvious choice.

### The Intentionally Misguided Crackdown on Law-Abiding Gun Owners

Instead of addressing the real issues fueling crime and admitting their failures, the government has shifted its focus to law-abiding gun owners, particularly in rural communities. In December 2024, the federal government added 324 firearms to its ban, a move widely criticized by firearm businesses as an attack on responsible citizens rather than criminals.

This crackdown ignores a critical fact: legally registered firearms are almost never used in violent crimes. According to Statistics Canada, among homicides where data was available, only 12% involving rifles or shotguns were committed by individuals with valid firearm licenses. The vast majority of firearm-related crimes involve illegally obtained weapons. Yet, instead of tackling illegal gun smuggling and organized crime, the government continues to burden lawful gun owners while ignoring the root cause of gun violence.

This raises a critical question: why does the government insist on disarming law-abiding citizens while criminals continue to operate with impunity? An unarmed population is easier to control, and history has repeatedly shown that governments seeking more authority often first target civilian firearms. 

The Second Amendment in the United States exists precisely to protect the First Amendment; preventing this kind of overreach—ensuring that the people retain the power to defend themselves not just from crime, but from tyranny itself. The idea that banning guns will keep firearms out of the hands of criminals is pure fantasy. 

If criminals can and will obtain firearms illegally, then why should responsible citizens be denied the right to protect themselves? Just as people keep fire extinguishers in their homes before the fire department arrives, responsible gun ownership is about preparation and security—especially for those in rural areas where law enforcement response times can be dangerously slow considering [Police response rates in the cities are now surpassing 45-minutes.](https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/2024/03/20/winnipeg-dissatisfied-police-force-survey/)

### The Urgency of Action

The Canada we once knew—strong, proud, and free—is rapidly fading. If we do not take decisive action now, we risk losing our national identity forever. It is time to restore pride, demand accountability, and ensure that the future of Canada remains one of strength, unity, and unwavering cultural identity. A nation that abandons its history, disrespects its traditions, and refuses to instill pride in its citizens is on the path to self-destruction. We must reclaim our heritage, not erase it. Only through acknowledging both the good and the bad can we move forward as a stronger and more united Canada.

## Canada's Democratic Dysfunction: A Nation Run by Ottawa, for Ottawa

Canada is fracturing. The federal government is failing to represent the diverse realities of the country, and instead of fixing the system, Ottawa continues to tighten its grip. Electoral reform was promised, then abandoned, regional frustrations are boiling over, and national unity is hanging by a thread. The one-size-fits-all model isn't working, and unless power is shifted back to the provinces, Canada will continue its slow descent into political disarray and regional rebellion.

### The Broken Electoral System: A Rigged Game
- Canada's First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system is a joke.
- Trudeau's Liberals won 100% of the power in 2015 with just 39% of the vote—meaning 61% of Canadians didn't vote for them, yet they ruled unchecked.
- In 2019 and 2021, Trudeau held onto power despite getting fewer votes than the Conservatives—his urban voter base gave him more seats, even though the majority of Canadians rejected him.
- Western Canada's votes are meaningless—Alberta conservatives can win 70%+ of the vote locally but have zero national influence.

Trudeau vowed in 2015 that it would be "the last election under FPTP." That was a lie. The moment he realized the broken system benefited him, he scrapped electoral reform.

This is not a democracy—it's a party cartel, where power is hoarded in Ottawa and entire regions of the country are permanently locked out.

## The Great Canadian Sellout: Why Are We Funding Foreign Governments While Our Own People Suffer?

> "Foreign aid is taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries." – Ron Paul

Canada once stood as a beacon of prosperity, unity, and national pride. But fast forward to 2024, and we’re a nation on life support—economically drained, culturally eroded, and systematically dismantled by reckless policies that put everyone else before our own people.

The cherry on top? Billions of our hard-earned tax dollars are being funneled to foreign nations while our veterans sleep on the streets, our hospitals overflow, and our youth struggle to afford homes.

### Where's Our Money Going?

Last week, we learned that $100 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine that President Zelensky [just admitted went missing?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/05/facebook-posts/zelenskyys-statement-about-ukraine-aid-didnt-revea/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Yes, you read that right—ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS of taxpayer money, vanishing into the abyss of corruption, with Ukrainian officials were conveniently reported buying new yachts and luxury properties.
And Canada? We’re not far behind in the ‘financial masochism’ department. Over $20 billion of our tax dollars were thrown into foreign aid in 2023 alone, with millions allocated to gender ideology programs in developing nations. Because, apparently, our government thinks funding woke indoctrination overseas is more important than feeding our own starving citizens.

Even better, just days ago, the Canadian government [wiped all public records of its spending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeD1vjgjEyc). What an incredible coincidence—right after USAID got exposed for billions in taxpayer fraud! But don’t worry, folks, we’re sure there’s absolutely nothing shady going on behind closed doors.

### Selling Out Our Own People

While our government hemorrhages cash abroad, let’s take a look at the state of our own backyard:

- **Homelessness and Poverty:** Tens of thousands of Canadians live in tents under bridges, including veterans who risked their lives for our freedom. Meanwhile, our government is wiring money overseas to build vacation homes for the elite in other countries before fixing our own housing crisis.
- **Healthcare Crisis:** Emergency rooms are so overwhelmed that people are dying in waiting rooms. But don’t worry, we’ve got enough money to bankroll gender studies programs in foreign countries!
- **Soaring Crime Rates:** Criminals walk free under “rehabilitation-focused” policies while law-abiding Canadians suffer. Why? Because we need to be ‘compassionate.’

But hey, at least the Canadian flag is being replaced with foreign ones in our institutions, so we can feel really good about our inclusivity while our national identity gets flushed down the toilet.

### Why Are We Funding the World When Our Own People Are Starving?

Not a single taxpayer dollar should leave our borders until every single Canadian has a home, food, education, and proper medical and mental health care.
Veterans, single mothers, the working class, indigenous communities—these should be our priorities. Instead, we send billions to corrupt foreign leaders who laugh at our generosity while we scrape by.
It’s time to stop financing foreign corruption and start investing in our own people. Canada first. Always.

### Mass Formation: The COVID Compliance Experiment

Canada became a global embarrassment during COVID. It wasn't just the [lockdowns](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/measures-reduce-community.html), [curfews](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/measures-in-force/curfew), and [vaccine mandates](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/news/2021/10/vaccination-requirement-for-federal-workforce-including-rcmp.html)—it was the zombie-like compliance of the public.

- [Grocery stores taped off "non-essential" goods](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-new-covid-19-restrictions-1.5797953). People lined up like cattle and obeyed.
- [Police arrested pastors](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-pastor-arrest-bail-hearing-1.5947440) for holding church services. The public cheered.
- Canadians [ratted out their neighbors](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-snitch-lines-social-media-shaming-help-maintain-covid-19-social/) for having family gatherings. We turned on each other like trained informants.

The [trucker convoy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/emergencies-act-inquiry-report-1.6780051) exposed the truth: Anyone who dared resist was crushed. The government didn't engage in dialogue—it [froze bank accounts](https://financialpost.com/news/fp-street/banks-started-freezing-accounts-after-emergencies-act-invoked), [seized donations](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/millions-in-convoy-funds-remain-frozen-until-resolution-of-court-case-mayor-1.5885440), and declared peaceful protesters a national threat.

Canada proved that authoritarianism doesn't need to be forced—it can be welcomed. Just pump enough fear into the public, and they'll beg for their own oppression.

Remember, this was all under the guise of "protecting our health," the government [banned teachers from buying glue sticks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-new-covid-19-restrictions-1.5797953) and loose-leaf for classrooms—yet kept [liquor stores open](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-lcbo-beer-wine-liquor-sales-covid-19-1.5734937), cigarettes on the shelves, and even [legalized the purchase of Schedule I narcotics](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/supervised-consumption-sites/status-application.html). Yeah, they really care about our well-being, right? Meanwhile, they flood every street corner with ultra-processed, chemical-laden junk food while telling us to ["stay inside for our safety."](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html) Wake up—does this sound like a government that actually gives a damn about your health?

They swore the vaccines were [100% effective](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-fauci-efficacy-idUSL1N2PB2WH)—take the shot, and you won't get COVID or spread it. That was the promise. The reality? A complete sham. The vaccine [never stopped transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness.html), and it never prevented infection. At best, it may have slightly reduced symptoms, but the grand narrative was a lie from the start.

And let's talk about the "lab leak theory." If you dared suggest COVID was man-made, you were [branded a conspiracy theorist](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/27/1000780650/the-debate-over-origins-of-covid-19-continues), silenced, and mocked. The official story? Some guy ate a bat, and the whole world shut down. Insane.

Fast forward—[the CIA just admitted COVID was created in a lab](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/covid-origin-china-lab-leak-cia-40d218d9). So the so-called "conspiracy theorists" were right all along, and the people who blindly trusted the government got played.

The irony is undeniable—we pretend COVID is a thing of the past, yet it never went away. It’s still here. The fact that life snapped back to normal so fast only proves how overhyped and catastrophically mismanaged the entire situation was.

Wake up, people. They [lied about the origins](https://www.science.org/content/article/covid-19-origins-still-uncertain-key-studies-awaiting-release), they [lied about the vaccines](https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2960), and they lied about the entire pandemic response. How much more proof do you need?

[Justin Trudeau himself once said](https://rumble.com/vma7wr-trudeu-little-dirty-secrets-about-politics.html), “Do you want to know the dirty little secret about politics in the 21st century? Negative campaigning, attack ads, nastiness, and division work. If all you want to do is get elected, they will help you get elected. Attacking, dividing, sowing fear—picking and choosing wedge issues to drive through a community—all of it helps you win.”

While many see Trudeau and his handlers as incompetent, this isn’t a bug in their strategy—it’s the feature. The setup is deliberate: divide the people, shift the blame away from themselves, and create an “us vs. them” narrative. Instead of being viewed as the perpetrator, they position themselves as the savior. Promising free money to everyone, call a snap election, and securing their continued reign of power, they are already discussing another ["pandemic type responses to the tariffs"](https://www.forexlive.com/news/canada-planning-covid-style-stimulus-if-us-enacts-tariffs-in-bid-to-avoid-early-election-20250128/), which again, is conveniently timed to the election. Brilliant.

*I'll stop here, because this subject is its own rabbit hole for an entire other paper…!*

### Western Alienation is Reaching a Breaking Point

Canada is massive—economically, culturally, and geographically diverse. But the federal government only listens to Ontario and Quebec because that's where the votes are.

The result? Western Canada is furious.

- In 2019, [33% of Albertans and 27% of Saskatchewanians](https://www.angusreid.org/western-canada-separatism/) said they'd be better off separating from Canada—the highest numbers ever recorded.
- A staggering [80% of Westerners](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-poll-finds-majority-of-western-canadians-feel-alienated/) believe Canada is "more divided than ever" and that Ottawa doesn't represent them.
- The term ["Wexit"](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/wexit-western-separation-alberta-saskatchewan-1.5346087) entered mainstream conversation as a real, growing sentiment.

Why? Because the **federal government openly sabotages the West.**

- [Carbon taxes](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work.html), [pipeline cancellations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/keystone-xl-biden-trudeau-alberta-kenney-1.5877038), and anti-energy policies are all designed to cripple Western economies while Ontario and Quebec reap the benefits.
- [Equalization payments](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/equalization.html) drain Alberta's wealth and redistribute it to provinces that oppose its industries.
- Ottawa [dictates energy and environmental policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan.html), ignoring the fact that Canada's prosperity depends on the very industries it's suffocating.

This isn't a **federation—it's economic warfare.**

### Provinces Are Fighting Back—And They Should Be

The West is done waiting for Ottawa to change. They're taking power back.

- Alberta's [Sovereignty Act](https://www.alberta.ca/sovereignty-within-united-canada-act.aspx) gives the province the right to ignore unconstitutional federal policies—a direct response to Ottawa's overreach.
- Saskatchewan passed ["Sask First" legislation](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2023/saskatchewan-first-act), ensuring resource control stays local.
- Even [Newfoundland once threatened](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/williams-canadian-flag-1.3392242) to remove Canadian flags over disputes with Ottawa.
- [Quebec has already set the precedent](https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/quebec-nation)—they dictate their own policies on immigration, language, and social issues with near-total autonomy.

The solution? [Decentralization](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/fiscal-federalism-and-the-dependency-of-provinces-on-federal-transfers). Provinces should control their own energy policies, tax structures, and economic decisions—instead of begging Ottawa for fairness.

### The System is Rigged for Ottawa Elites

- The [Prime Minister's Office (PMO)](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/publications/guide-book-government.html) has near-dictatorial power. Parliament is just a rubber stamp.
- [MPs don't represent their ridings](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/party-standings)—they vote how party leaders tell them.
- Trudeau has [prorogued Parliament](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-prorogue-parliament-1.5687735) to avoid scandals, [silenced committees](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberals-shut-down-probe-into-sexual-misconduct-in-canadian-military/), and blocked debate with [gag orders](https://www.ourcommons.ca/about/procedureandpractice3rdedition/ch_14_4-e.html).

This is why Canadians are disengaging. [Voter turnout is plummeting](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=ele&dir=turn&document=index&lang=e)—why vote when the system is rigged?

### The Fix: Real Decentralization and Electoral Reform

- [Electoral reform must happen](https://www.fairvote.ca/proportional-representation/)—whether it's proportional representation or a ranked ballot system, votes must actually count.
- [More power to the provinces](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/fiscal-federalism-and-the-dependency-of-provinces-on-federal-transfers)—regional governments should have the final say on their industries, resources, and policies.
- [Break Ottawa's grip on power](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/time-to-fix-canadas-democracy/)—MPs should represent their ridings, not be puppets of party leaders.
- [Revamp the Senate](https://sencanada.ca/en/about/transparencyandaccountability/) or scrap it—an unelected chamber of appointed cronies serves no one.

### The Future: Decentralize or Collapse

Canada cannot survive as a country if [regional alienation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-western-alienation-is-very-real-and-dangerous-heres-how-to-fix-it/) continues to grow. The federal government's refusal to listen to the West, reform democracy, or stop its economic sabotage is creating a nation where unity is an illusion.

Either Ottawa returns power to the provinces, or Canada will tear itself apart. There is no in-between.

## Reclaiming Canada: A Nation Worth Fighting For

Canada stands at a breaking point. The signs of decline—[economic decay](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-the-decline-in-canadian-living-standards), [government overreach](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/index.html), social division, crumbling infrastructure, and political dysfunction—are undeniable. For too long, we've been told to accept it, to lower our expectations, to stay quiet, and comply. But let me be clear: this does not have to be our future.

Nations do not die overnight—they erode, piece by piece, while their people stand by and watch. But history is written by those who refuse to sit back. We still have time to course correct—but only if we act now. This is not a call for empty outrage or passive complaining. This is a call to fight—not with violence, but with action, with our voices, and with an unshakable will to take back our country.

### Step One: Take Back Our Freedom

No government will ever willingly give back the power it has taken. It must be forced to by the people. That means:

- No more [emergency powers](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/emergencies-urgences.html) without real oversight. Never again should a government be able to freeze bank accounts or silence opposition because it finds dissent inconvenient.
- [Repeal the speech control laws](https://www.jccf.ca/free-speech/). We don't need a government nanny telling us what we can watch, say, or think.
- End [state-funded media manipulation](https://www.heritage.gc.ca/eng/content/journalism-support-fund). Let the press stand on its own, free from government control. If they can't survive without handouts, they don't deserve to survive.

### Step Two: Demand Real Leadership, Not Performative Politics

The days of electing weak, pandering politicians who use power to enrich themselves must end. We need:
- A government that [respects your paycheck](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-the-tax-burden-on-canadian-families), not one that takes half of it. Runaway debt, bloated bureaucracy, and reckless spending must be crushed.
- [Accountability in leadership](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/au_fs_e_371.html). If a politician lies, they should be thrown out. If they steal from taxpayers, they should be prosecuted. If they fail at their job, they should be replaced. No more excuses.
- [Decentralization of power](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/time-to-fix-canadas-democracy/). The West, the Maritimes, and the North should not be ruled by the whims of Toronto and Montreal. Canada is too big for a one-size-fits-all approach. Give power back to the provinces where it belongs.

### Step Three: Reject Weakness—Strengthen Our Nation

A weak country is a dead country. Right now, we are wide open to collapse:
- We have [no real military](https://www.cgai.ca/defence_policy_review). We can't defend ourselves, and we expect the Americans to protect us. That is not sovereignty—that is dependence.
- We have a [housing crisis](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/housing-data) fueled by out-of-control immigration. Either we slow immigration to a sustainable level or build like we mean it. Doing neither is a guaranteed disaster.
- We have a government [addicted to making you dependent](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/growing-government-makes-canadians-more-economically-dependent). If you think state handouts mean security, just wait until the money runs out. The government doesn't take care of you—it controls you.

### Step Four: Stop Being Passive—Start Taking Control

Canadians have been conditioned to comply, obey, and hope for the best. That mentality must die. If you're sick of what's happening, then do something about it.

- Make your voice impossible to ignore. [Write](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en), [protest](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art2c.html), organize. [Flood your MPs with pressure](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/search)—they work for you, not the other way around.
- [Reject the fear of speaking out](https://www.jccf.ca/free-speech/). Stop whispering in private about how bad things are. Say it loudly and say it often.
- [Hold weak leaders accountable](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/au_fs_e_371.html). If they lie, if they steal, if they fail—demand their resignation.

### Canada's Future: Chosen By You

We are not powerless. We are not doomed. But we are out of time to stay silent. Every year we accept [higher taxes](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-the-tax-burden-on-canadian-families), [lower wages](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/11/staff-analytical-note-2023-19/), fewer freedoms, and more incompetence, we make it harder to reverse course.

This country was built by fighters, pioneers, warriors, and innovators—not by obedient, passive followers. We can reclaim that spirit. We can fix this.


### The question is: 

### Will you fight for Canada, or will you sit back and watch it fall?

## Liberal Scandals:

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party have faced multiple allegations of ethical misconduct and corruption during their tenure, leading to significant public scrutiny and criticism.

### SNC-Lavalin Affair

In 2019, it was revealed that [Trudeau and his officials attempted to influence](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-snc-lavalin-ethics-1.5246551) then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of [SNC-Lavalin](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-snc-lavalin-what-happened-and-what-does-it-mean/), a major engineering firm accused of corruption and fraud related to contracts in Libya. The [federal ethics commissioner concluded](https://ciec-ccie.parl.gc.ca/en/investigations-enquetes/Pages/TrudeauIIReport-RapportTrudeauII.aspx) that Trudeau violated the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould. This scandal led to [high-profile resignations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jody-wilson-raybould-resignation-1.5017211) within the Liberal Party and raised serious concerns about the integrity of the government's judicial processes.

### WE Charity Controversy

In 2020, the Liberal government [awarded a $43.53 million contract](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/we-charity-student-grant-trudeau-covid-1.5666676) to WE Charity to administer a $900 million student volunteer program. It was later disclosed that [members of Trudeau's family had received substantial speaking fees](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-we-charity-contract-scandal-explainer/) from the organization, leading to accusations of favoritism and conflict of interest. Although Trudeau defended the decision, citing WE Charity's extensive network, the backlash forced the organization to [withdraw from the contract](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/we-charity-student-grant-1.5642642), and the ethics commissioner launched an investigation into the matter.

### McKinsey & Company Contracts

Investigations in 2023 revealed that the Trudeau government had [significantly increased its spending](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mckinsey-contracts-house-committee-1.6724393) on consulting firm McKinsey & Company, totaling at least [$117.4 million since taking office](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-house-of-commons-committee-probes-federal-contracts-with-mckinsey/), compared to $2.2 million by the previous government. All contracts were [sole-sourced](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/01/20/opinion/mckinsey-scandal-more-just-liberal-patronage), bypassing competitive bidding processes. This raised concerns about transparency, accountability, and the potential undue influence of external consultants on public policy, particularly in areas like immigration.

### Delaying Elections Amid Trade Tensions

Critics have accused the Liberal Party of [postponing elections](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/what-is-the-liberal-ndp-deal) during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the recent trade tensions with the United States, to maintain their political standing. By [delaying the electoral process](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-liberal-agreement-1.6395274), the party is perceived as prioritizing its hold on power over democratic accountability, potentially undermining public trust in governmental institutions.

### Tax Avoidance

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly stated that neither he nor his family have holdings in offshore accounts. In response to inquiries following the [Panama Papers leak](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/), Trudeau affirmed his transparency regarding personal and family finances, emphasizing that Canadians expect such openness from their leaders.

However, the [2017 Paradise Papers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/paradise-papers-trudeau-bronfman-1.4387338) revealed that Stephen Bronfman, a close friend, adviser, and chief fundraiser for Trudeau's Liberal Party, was linked to offshore trusts that may have been used to avoid taxes in Canada, the United States, and Israel. These revelations appeared to contrast with Trudeau's public stance on tax fairness.
