Hey there, real estate enthusiasts! Today, I'm pulling back the curtain on how I transformed a rundown triplex into a cash cow using the **BRRRR method** and expanded my investing horizons by venturing **3,100 km away from home**. Whether you're new to real estate or a seasoned investor, this strategy can be a game-changer. Let’s dive in.

## What Is the BRRRR Method?

First things first—**BRRRR** stands for **Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat**. It's a systematic way to build wealth by acquiring properties that need some TLC, fixing them up, renting them out, and pulling out the equity to buy more properties.

### Here's a quick breakdown:
1. **Buy:** Snag a property below market value.
2. **Rehab:** Fix it up to increase its value and rental potential.
3. **Rent:** Find tenants to generate steady income.
4. **Refinance:** Get the property appraised and take out a mortgage to recover your initial investment.
5. **Repeat:** Use the money to buy your next project.

## Broadening Horizons: Investing 3,100 km Away in Saint John, New Brunswick 

### How One Phone Call Changed Everything

I had an enlightening conversation with Brock Rogerson, a seasoned real estate investor based in Calgary. Brock owned an impressive portfolio of around 33 rental properties just in Winnipeg, and I was looking to purchase eight of them through a vendor financing deal. Essentially, this strategy would allow me to acquire these income-generating properties with no money down—a highly leveraged approach. While risky, this method can be a powerful way to build an asset base quickly, provided the cash flow from the properties is sufficient to service the debt.

During our discussion, I was curious about what Brock planned to do with the funds from selling some of his properties. His response surprised me: he had been investing heavily in Saint John, New Brunswick. Intrigued, I started researching Saint John properties on Realtor.ca while we were still on the call. What I found was shocking—properties in Saint John were listed at prices that seemed almost too good to be true. I initially thought there must be a catch, but Brock assured me that these prices were legitimate. He went on to explain why he believed Saint John was a promising market for real estate investment.

After our call ended, I couldn’t shake the idea of investing in Saint John. Within two weeks, I made a decision and called Brock back. I told him I was no longer interested in purchasing his Winnipeg properties. He was understanding and said it was no problem. A week later, Brock called me back, asking me to reconsider, but by then, my focus had fully shifted. I declined once more.

During that second call, he overheard some background noise of an intercom system and asked, “Where are you right now?”

I told him, “I’m at the Montreal airport.”

“Where are you going?” he asked.

“Saint John, New Brunswick,” I replied.

"You f***er!" he said with a mix of humor and exasperation.

Despite the playful jab, Brock was a good sport and shared valuable advice about the Saint John market. He pointed out areas to avoid, recommended trusted professionals to work with, and flagged potential challenges to watch out for. His guidance proved invaluable as I began exploring this new real estate opportunity.

That single conversation with Brock completely changed my investment trajectory. It’s a great reminder of how keeping an open mind—and asking the right questions—can uncover opportunities you might never have considered.

This was the beginning of a realization that changed my entire approach to real estate: **I didn’t need to invest where I lived.**

## The Myth of Investing in Your Backyard

Many investors cling to the idea that they need to buy properties close to home. It feels safer. But as I started exploring Saint John, I saw how limiting that mindset truly is. With today's technology—Zoom, DocuSign, online banking, and property management platforms—it’s easier than ever to invest in markets far from home.

Think about it:
- If a property floods, what am I going to do by standing there? I'm going to call a professional.
- If a tenant doesn’t pay, am I going to knock on their door? No—I’ll call my property manager.

Living near your properties doesn’t solve problems; it often creates more distractions.

## The Triplex Transformation: Applying BRRRR in a New Market

### Finding the Perfect Diamond in the Rough

In Saint John, I stumbled upon a triplex listed for **$64,900**. It had been sitting on the market for over 120 days because it was, frankly, a disaster—walls ripped out, knob-and-tube wiring (a big no-no for insurance companies), and literal garbage everywhere. Most people wouldn’t touch it—but I saw potential.

### Negotiating the Deal

I hired an inspector to highlight all the property’s flaws and presented the sellers with a list of renovation costs. They agreed to sell for **$40,000**, and I paid cash because the property was in such bad shape and to cheap for me to finance. I considered cash advancing a credit card for the payment, but opted for a credit line. This was an easy cash play for me, and it was time to get to work.

### The Rehab: Turning Trash into Treasure

I budgeted **$35,725** for renovations. Here’s how I allocated the funds:
- **Electrical Upgrade:** $12,000 to bring it up to code.
- **Garbage Removal:** Six dump runs costing $1,500.
- **Fire-Rated Doors & Fixtures:** $5,000 for safety and aesthetics.
- **Hardwood Refinishing:** Instead of installing new floors, I refinished the existing hardwood to preserve the character.

With a bit of paint, trim, and updated kitchens and bathrooms, the property was unrecognizable. Each unit—three flats with three bedrooms and one bathroom each—was now move-in ready.

## The Numbers: Before and After

- **Purchase Price:** $40,000
- **Renovation Costs:** $35,725
- **Total Investment:** $75,725

### Rental Income:
- Two units rented for **$950/month** (heat and electricity included).
- One unit rented for **$750/month** (tenants pay utilities).
- **Total Monthly Rent:** $2,550

After accounting for vacancy, maintenance, and utilities, the property nets me **$1,280/month** in profit. And I hadn’t even refinanced yet.

## Refinancing: The Real Magic of BRRRR

After the renovations, I had the property appraised. The new value? **$105,000**! I approached the bank for a **75% loan-to-value (LTV)** mortgage, which means they gave me **$79,000**.

Since my total investment was $75,725, I not only recouped my entire investment but also walked away with an extra **$3,275**. Yep, I got paid to buy this property.

## Final Thoughts

My decision to invest in Saint John taught me a valuable lesson: **The best deals often aren’t in your backyard.** With the right systems, technology, and partners, you can build a thriving portfolio anywhere. By focusing on scalable deals and letting the numbers guide me, I’ve been able to grow my business without being tied to a single location.
