3 Hacks to Instantly Slash Your Hydro Bill (and Build Some Character While Youâ€™re at It)

Ready to save big on your hydro bill while toughening up a little? Hereâ€™s the game plan: ditch the dryer, say goodbye to your dishwasher, and embrace cold showers.

Before you dismiss this as the ramblings of a lunatic, stick with me for a minuteâ€”I promise itâ€™ll be worth your time.

Most people think saving on their hydro bill just means turning off a few lights. Thatâ€™s fine if youâ€™re content with baby steps, but if youâ€™re as ultra-frugal as me, youâ€™re ready to go all-in.

Letâ€™s skip the five-page essay and get straight to the point. Hereâ€™s why these changes workâ€”and how much youâ€™ll save.

The Average Household Hydro Reality  
Typical North American household: ~12,500 kWh/year (~1,041 kWh/month).  
Manitoba Hydro rate: $0.0896/kWh.  
Thatâ€™s about $89.60/month before taxes.  

Now, with Manitoba Hydro planning a 15% annual rate hike for the next 4 years (a 60% total increase), the cost of doing nothing isnâ€™t just highâ€”itâ€™s skyrocketing.

**Hack #1: Kill the Dryer**  
Your dryer is an electricity monster. Flip its breaker off and let it go. Instead, hang-dry your clothes: theyâ€™ll smell fresher, last longer, and cost you nothing.

DIY Setup:

Install a simple drying rack (I used a 10-foot, 1-inch pipe in my basementâ€”total cost: $5).  
Savings? Massive. Youâ€™ll notice the difference on your bill immediately.

**Hack #2: Fire the Dishwasher**  
Dishwashers are another sneaky energy hog. Washing dishes by hand takes less time than you think and delivers better results.

The Alternative:

Grab a dish wand for $3â€”itâ€™ll last months and works wonders.
Turn off the dishwasher breaker, and youâ€™ve just slashed a chunk off your monthly bill.

**Hack #3: Embrace Cold Showers**  
This oneâ€™s a bit tougherâ€”but worth it. Your hot water tank is a hidden power-sucking demon, consuming 19% of your monthly electricity.

Hereâ€™s the math:

A 50-gallon, 5,500-watt water heater running ~5 hours/day costs $73.92/month ($887.04/year).  
By switching to cold showers, you can reduce that cost to around $18.48/month.  

Why Itâ€™s Worth It:

Over 15 years, investing the savings at a 7â€“10% annual return could grow to $22,795.87.  
Youâ€™ll also save time (because, letâ€™s be real, youâ€™ll want to get out fast).  
Benefits Beyond Savings  
Cold showers arenâ€™t just a cost-cutting trickâ€”theyâ€™re a health boost. They:  

Improve circulation.  
Strengthen immunity.  
Stimulate fat loss.  
Boost testosterone (for the guys).  
Start small: gradually lower the temperature each day until youâ€™re fully comfortable with cold. Soon, it wonâ€™t feel as crazy as it sounds.  

The Results?  
By cutting our householdâ€™s energy usage from 1,100 kWh/month to just 230â€“250 kWh/month, weâ€™ve reduced our hydro bill to $25/month.

These small changes add up fast, saving you thousands in the long runâ€”all while toughening you up and building real character.
