What if I told you about a unique machine that can transport you anywhere you want to go without requiring gasoline, diesel, or any fuels? A machine that doesn't need oil changes or overpriced car washes—a machine that could save you $2,000 each year on car insurance.

What if I told you that while you operate this machine, it draws energy from your own body, tones your legs and arms, and even gives you a nice tan in the warmer months? Did I mention it's only a few minutes slower than driving a car?

"What on earth could possibly do all that? The value must be worth thousands of dollars!"

Well, for our first frugal living tip, I'm here to tell you that a device offering all these benefits can cost you less than $100. Yes, that's right—$100. It's called a bike! There are hundreds of great bikes available on Kijiji and Craigslist that will cost you less than what you spend on lunch for a week, saving you thousands of dollars and providing immediate benefits.

I've been riding my bike for a week now and have only had to drive my car once ($3 spent on gas this week). I've biked to work, the grocery store, the gym, appointments, and even Home Depot. Every time I get on the bike, I fall more in love with it! I wish it hadn't taken me so long to figure this out.

One thing I've noticed as I zip around on my bike is how many people stare from the windows of their idling, emission-producing cars while sitting at stoplights and turn lanes, often snacking as they wait. I can't help but wonder what's going through their minds as they see me riding past on my bicycle:

"This person must be crazy, broke, or have some issue—why would anyone ride a bike to work?"

Little do they know that I have twice the savings, am half their age, have no car debt, and am on a path to retire 30 years before they ever do. While they sit back and judge, possibly taking years off their lives, I'm pedaling by and adding years to mine. So who's the crazy one here?

If you live within 10 kilometers of your workplace, there's no reason you shouldn't be biking. The difference in time is only a few short minutes. What really surprises me is people who drive to the gym—how ironic is that? The whole point is to be active, isn't it? Yet every time I arrive at the gym, the enormous parking lot is jam-packed with vehicles.

"But I work too far from my house; I could never bike—it would take too long."

Nonsense! It takes me 35 minutes to drive from the East End (Transcona) of Winnipeg to the West End (Route 90). It takes me less than 45 minutes to do it on a bike. You're telling me you can't find an extra 10 minutes in your day for thousands of dollars in savings?

"It's a good idea, but what about winter? We all know how harsh Winnipeg gets during the snowy months."

If the roads and sidewalks are cleared, I don't see that being an issue. This winter, I'll find out and continue this post.

"What about bike theft or vandalism? I work in a rough area of the city."

Good news! Pedal Power has just come to Manitoba by storm. For $52 per year, you can insure a bike valued up to $1,000 against theft and vandalism.

I have yet to see any downsides to riding my bike. Once I do, you'll be the first to know. Until then, I'll keep burning calories and saving money!

Below are two items that have greatly helped me adjust to everyday biking:

Utility Daypack: I use this to carry everything I need—from meals and tools to even steel-toed boots—around the city on my bike. It's waterproof, durable, comes with a lifetime warranty, and is affordable.

Bike Smartphone Mount: Worth every penny.
