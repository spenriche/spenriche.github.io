Imagine walking into an apartment complex where the chief of police hands you the building's key—not as a welcome gesture, but because of the frequent disturbances. That was the scene I faced when I first stepped into what would become one of the more memorable projects of my real estate journey.

## A Troubled Beginning

The complex was a portrait of neglect:
- **Mismanagement**: Owned by an individual struggling with financial hardship and managed remotely from another city.
- **Crime and Vandalism**: Stories of unpaid rent, violent incidents, and frequent police interventions were common.
- **State of the Property**: 
  - Blood-smeared walls from a machete attack.
  - Corridors filled with cigarette smoke, drug paraphernalia, and loiterers.
  - Battered doors, graffiti-covered walls, and destroyed plumbing fixtures.
  - Tenants lived in fear and disorder.

## The Silver Lining

Amid the chaos, the property had potential:
- **Upgrades**: A few years ago, $750,000 was spent on enhancements including new windows and updated mechanical systems. These improvements, while not adding direct value to the property, signify a considerable capital outlay for future purchasers. The building's foundation was solid; however, the interiors were dated and dilapidated, with stained carpets covering all common areas—my top picks for upgrades because of the significant return on investment they offer.
- **Opportunity**: Despite its deterioration, the building hinted at what it could become with the right vision and effort.

## The Purchase

Acquiring the property came with its own challenges:
- **Price**: Purchased for **$1,050,000**, a significant discount—$600,000 less than its purchase price seven years earlier, despite the $750,000 in upgrades, 
- **Seller Financing Condition**: The seller had to secure financing to close the deal, highlighting the building’s dire state. This is the first time I've purchased a property where the seller had to secure financing to close the deal.
- **Parking Challenge**: The parking lot was owned by the seller. A trusted colleague submitted an offer to purchase it and assigned it to my company during closing to avoid leverage issues the previous owner could have held over us.

## Turning the Ship Around

Taking over the property required immediate and decisive action:

### Proactive Management
- Hands-on involvement was crucial with the community and local police department to evict violent and problematic tenants.
- Renovated vacant units one by one and began to lease up at affordable rates to attract responsible tenants.
- Overhauled common areas, replacing blood-stained carpets with luxury vinyl plank flooring.
- Added new ammenidities in the common areas for tenants to access suchas revamping the laundry facilities and adding a new community room.

### Security Overhaul
- Replaced traditional keys with modern phone-based access systems.
- Installed intercoms and a robust surveillance system.
- Engaged with local security company to be on call for any disturbances.
- Added security fencing to prevent loitering and drug use.

**A Personal Encounter**:
One night, while I was staying at the property to manage the transition and oversee renovations, I was jolted awake by screams in the hallway. A violent incident had unfolded where a woman was stabbed. Unarmed, I managed to de-escalate the situation and scare off the attacker until the police and paramedics could arrive, highlighting the critical need for our security upgrades.
